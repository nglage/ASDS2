    "# Exercise: Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in earlier exercise labs, we will be working with a dataset of tweets from USA Members of Congress. The version of the dataset used today includes the 3000 most recent tweets from each member, collected in 2021. We have created a subset of this dataset containing tweets from 2018 and later, to capture only fairly recent tweets as the dataset is very large. \n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing such a large dataset takes a while to run (approx 20 mins). To save you time and effort, we have uploaded a preprocessed version of the dataset: 'MOC2021_Tweets_2018subset_preprocessed.csv'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps were applied: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subsetting dataset to include only tweets from 2018 and later\n",
    "1. Removing duplicated tweets \n",
    "2. Removing unneeded columns (all except 'nominate_name','affiliation','role','nominate_score', and 'text')\n",
    "3. Turning independents into Democrats or Republicans. In essence, finding the independents (\"SANDERS, Bernard\" and \"KING, Angus Stanley, Jr.\") and turning these to \"Democrat\". \n",
    "4. Replace \"&\" with \"and\"\n",
    "5. Remove odd special characters (\"┻\",\"┃\",\"━\",\"┳\",\"┓\",\"┏\",\"┛\",\"┗\")\n",
    "6. There are some annoying cases in these data where a character that looks like a space is not a space. Here, we just replace that character with an actual space. Note that the first \"space\" is not actually a space. \" \" == \" \" is FALSE. Replace \"\\u202F\", \"\\u2069\", \"\\u200d\", and \"\\u2066\" with \" \".\n",
    "7. Removing \"RT\" and \"via\"\n",
    "8. Removing mentions (@someone)\n",
    "9. Removing numbers, removing punctuation (except hyphens), removing separators, removing urls, lowercasing, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing."

    "Import the dataset with preprocessed text 'MOC2021_Tweets_2018subset_preprocessed.csv'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the name of each member of Congress (nominate_name), their affiliation (Democrat or Republican), their institutional role in Congress (House or Senate), their ideological score based on how they vote in Congress (nominate_score) and the text of each of their most recent 3000 tweets, reaching back until the beginning of 2018, in original and preprocessed format. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The goal of our wordfish scaling today is to give each politician an ideological score based on their tweets. To prepare the data, we therefore need to aggregate all text per politician. In essence, transform the dataframe so that each row has one politician (rather than one tweet) and each text field includes all tweets from this politician in one long string. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hint for 1.1: When preprocessing, some tweet text was removed (e.g. if they were only URLs). To aggregate text, you may need to replace NaN values with an empty string. Next, the pandas functions `groupby` and `agg` can help you. These steps are the same as last week. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The wordfish scaler accepts data in the shape of a list of tuples containing the document name and the document text. Essentially that means that you should create a list in the format: [(politician1, preprocessed_text1), (politician2, preprocessed_text2), (politician3, preprocessed_text3)].\n"
