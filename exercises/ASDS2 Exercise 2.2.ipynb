In the general course of human nature, A POWER OVER A MAN's\\nSUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL. And we can never hope\\nto see realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial\\nfrom the legislative power, in any system which leaves the former\\ndependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the\\nlatter. The enlightened friends to good government in every State,\\nhave seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit\\nprecautions in the State constitutions on this head. Some of these\\nindeed have declared that PERMANENT [1] salaries should be\\nestablished for the judges; but the experiment has in some\\ninstances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite\\nto preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and\\nunequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The plan of the\\nconvention accordingly has provided that the judges of the United\\nStates \\\"shall at STATED TIMES receive for their services a\\ncompensation which shall not be DIMINISHED during their continuance\\nin office.\\\"\\n\\nThis, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible\\nprovision that could have been devised. It will readily be\\nunderstood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the\\nstate of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the\\nConstitution inadmissible. What might be extravagant to-day, might\\nin half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore\\nnecessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary\\nits provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet\\nunder such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body\\nto change the condition of the individual for the worse. A man may\\nthen be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be\\ndeterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less\\neligible situation. The clause which has been quoted combines both\\nadvantages. The salaries of judicial officers may from time to time\\nbe altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the\\nallowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in\\nrespect to him. It will be observed that a difference has been made\\nby the convention between the compensation of the President and of\\nthe judges, That of the former can neither be increased nor\\ndiminished; that of the latter can only not be diminished. This\\nprobably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective\\noffices. As the President is to be elected for no more than four\\nyears, it can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the\\ncommencement of that period, will not continue to be such to its end.\\nBut with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will\\nbe secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially\\nin the early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would\\nbe very sufficient at their first appointment, would become too\\nsmall in the progress of their service.\\n\\nThis provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of\\nprudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together\\nwith the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better\\nprospect of their independence than is discoverable in the\\nconstitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.\\n\\nThe precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the\\narticle respecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached\\nfor malconduct by the House of Representatives, and tried by the\\nSenate; and, if convicted, may be dismissed from office, and\\ndisqualified for holding any other. This is the only provision on\\nthe point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the\\njudicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own\\nConstitution in respect to our own judges.\\n\\nThe want of a provision for removing the judges on account of\\ninability has been a subject of complaint. But all considerate men\\nwill be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced\\nupon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any\\ngood purpose. The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, I\\nbelieve, no place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix\\nthe boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would\\nmuch oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and\\nenmities than advance the interests of justice or the public good.\\nThe result, except in the case of insanity, must for the most part\\nbe arbitrary; and insanity, without any formal or express\\nprovision, may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification.\\n\\nThe constitution of New York, to avoid investigations that must\\nforever be vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the\\ncriterion of inability. No man can be a judge beyond sixty. I\\nbelieve there are few at present who do not disapprove of this\\nprovision. There is no station, in relation to which it is less\\nproper than to that of a judge. The deliberating and comparing\\nfaculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period\\nin men who survive it; and when, in addition to this circumstance,\\nwe consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual\\nvigor, and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the\\nbench, whether more or less numerous, should be in such a situation\\nat the same time, we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of\\nthis sort have little to recommend them. In a republic, where\\nfortunes are not affluent, and pensions not expedient, the\\ndismission of men from stations in which they have served their\\ncountry long and usefully, on which they depend for subsistence, and\\nfrom which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for\\na livelihood, ought to have some better apology to humanity than is\\nto be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. Vide \\\"Constitution of Massachusetts,\\\" chapter 2, section\\nI, article 13.\\n\",\n          \"To the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nAFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the\\nsubsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on\\na new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject\\nspeaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences\\nnothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare\\nof the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many\\nrespects the most interesting in the world. It has been frequently\\nremarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this\\ncountry, by their conduct and example, to decide the important\\nquestion, whether societies of men are really capable or not of\\nestablishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether\\nthey are forever destined to depend for their political\\nconstitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth in the\\nremark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\\nregarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a\\nwrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve\\nto be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\\n\\nThis idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\\npatriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and\\ngood men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice\\nshould be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests,\\nunperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the\\npublic good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than\\nseriously to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations\\naffects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local\\ninstitutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects\\nforeign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little\\nfavorable to the discovery of truth.\\n\\nAmong the most formidable of the obstacles which the new\\nConstitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the\\nobvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist\\nall changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument,\\nand consequence of the offices they hold under the State\\nestablishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men,\\nwho will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of\\ntheir country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of\\nelevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial\\nconfederacies than from its union under one government.\\n\\nIt is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\\nnature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\\nindiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because\\ntheir situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or\\nambitious views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men\\nmay be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted\\nthat much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may\\nhereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless\\nat least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray\\nby preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so\\npowerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the\\njudgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the\\nwrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first\\nmagnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would\\nfurnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much\\npersuaded of their being in the right in any controversy. And a\\nfurther reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the\\nreflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the\\ntruth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists.\\nAmbition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many\\nother motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as\\nwell upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\\nquestion. Were there not even these inducements to moderation,\\nnothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which\\nhas, at all times, characterized political parties. For in\\npolitics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making\\nproselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be\\ncured by persecution.\\n\\nAnd yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we\\nhave already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as\\nin all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of\\nangry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the\\nconduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that\\nthey will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions,\\nand to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of\\ntheir declamations and the bitterness of their invectives. An\\nenlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be\\nstigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and\\nhostile to the principles of liberty. An over-scrupulous jealousy\\nof danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the\\nfault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere\\npretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense\\nof the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that\\njealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\\nenthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow\\nand illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally\\nforgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security\\nof liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed\\njudgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a\\ndangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal\\nfor the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of\\nzeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will\\nteach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to\\nthe introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men\\nwho have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number\\nhave begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people;\\ncommencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.\\n\\nIn the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye,\\nmy fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all\\nattempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a\\nmatter of the utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions\\nother than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You\\nwill, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general\\nscope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the\\nnew Constitution. Yes, my countrymen, I own to you that, after\\nhaving given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion\\nit is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced that this is the\\nsafest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I\\naffect not reserves which I do not feel. I will not amuse you with\\nan appearance of deliberation when I have decided. I frankly\\nacknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you\\nthe reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good\\nintentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\\nprofessions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository\\nof my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be\\njudged of by all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which\\nwill not disgrace the cause of truth.\\n\\nI propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following\\ninteresting particulars:\\n\\nTHE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY\\n\\nTHE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION\\nTO PRESERVE THAT UNION  THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST\\nEQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS\\nOBJECT  THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE\\nPRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT\\nITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION\\nand lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS\\nADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF\\nGOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\\n\\nIn the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\\nsatisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made\\ntheir appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\\n\\nIt may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to\\nprove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved\\non the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and\\none, which it may be imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is,\\nthat we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those\\nwho oppose the new Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too\\ngreat extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity\\nresort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the\\nwhole. [1] This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually\\npropagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open\\navowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to those who are\\nable to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative\\nof an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the\\nUnion. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the\\nadvantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable\\ndangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution.\\nThis shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is\\nheld out in several of the late publications against the new\\nConstitution.\\n\",\n          \"To the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nI PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed\\nExecutive, as they are marked out in the plan of the convention.\\nThis will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the\\nrepresentations which have been made in regard to it.\\n\\nThe first thing which strikes our attention is, that the\\nexecutive authority, with few exceptions, is to be vested in a\\nsingle magistrate. This will scarcely, however, be considered as a\\npoint upon which any comparison can be grounded; for if, in this\\nparticular, there be a resemblance to the king of Great Britain,\\nthere is not less a resemblance to the Grand Seignior, to the khan\\nof Tartary, to the Man of the Seven Mountains, or to the governor of\\nNew York.\\n\\nThat magistrate is to be elected for FOUR years; and is to be\\nre-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think\\nhim worthy of their confidence. In these circumstances there is a\\ntotal dissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain, who is\\nan HEREDITARY monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony\\ndescendible to his heirs forever; but there is a close analogy\\nbetween HIM and a governor of New York, who is elected for THREE\\nyears, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission. If we\\nconsider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a\\ndangerous influence in a single State, than for establishing a like\\ninfluence throughout the United States, we must conclude that a\\nduration of FOUR years for the Chief Magistrate of the Union is a\\ndegree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office, than a\\nduration of THREE years for a corresponding office in a single State.\\n\\nThe President of the United States would be liable to be\\nimpeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other\\nhigh crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would\\nafterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary\\ncourse of law. The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred\\nand inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is\\namenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without\\ninvolving the crisis of a national revolution. In this delicate and\\nimportant circumstance of personal responsibility, the President of\\nConfederated America would stand upon no better ground than a\\ngovernor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of\\nMaryland and Delaware.\\n\\nThe President of the United States is to have power to return a\\nbill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature,\\nfor reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law,\\nif, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both\\nhouses. The king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute\\nnegative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament. The disuse\\nof that power for a considerable time past does not affect the\\nreality of its existence; and is to be ascribed wholly to the\\ncrown's having found the means of substituting influence to\\nauthority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of\\nthe two houses, to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which\\ncould seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national\\nagitation. The qualified negative of the President differs widely\\nfrom this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and tallies\\nexactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of\\nthis State, of which the governor is a constituent part. In this\\nrespect the power of the President would exceed that of the governor\\nof New York, because the former would possess, singly, what the\\nlatter shares with the chancellor and judges; but it would be\\nprecisely the same with that of the governor of Massachusetts, whose\\nconstitution, as to this article, seems to have been the original\\nfrom which the convention have copied.\\n\\nThe President is to be the \\\"commander-in-chief of the army and\\nnavy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States,\\nwhen called into the actual service of the United States. He is to\\nhave power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the\\nUnited States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT; to recommend to the\\nconsideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary\\nand expedient; to convene, on extraordinary occasions, both houses\\nof the legislature, or either of them, and, in case of disagreement\\nbetween them WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF ADJOURNMENT, to adjourn\\nthem to such time as he shall think proper; to take care that the\\nlaws be faithfully executed; and to commission all officers of the\\nUnited States.\\\" In most of these particulars, the power of the\\nPresident will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain\\nand of the governor of New York. The most material points of\\ndifference are these:  First. The President will have only the\\noccasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by\\nlegislative provision may be called into the actual service of the\\nUnion. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have\\nat all times the entire command of all the militia within their\\nseveral jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the\\nPresident would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the\\ngovernor. Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief\\nof the army and navy of the United States. In this respect his\\nauthority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great\\nBritain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to\\nnothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military\\nand naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy;\\nwhile that of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and\\nto the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all which, by\\nthe Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the\\nlegislature. [1] The governor of New York, on the other hand, is\\nby the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its\\nmilitia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States\\nexpressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well\\nof the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those\\nof New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this\\ninstance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than\\ncould be claimed by a President of the United States. Thirdly.\\nThe power of the President, in respect to pardons, would extend to\\nall cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The governor of New York\\nmay pardon in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for\\ntreason and murder. Is not the power of the governor, in this\\narticle, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than\\nthat of the President? All conspiracies and plots against the\\ngovernment, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be\\nscreened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the\\nprerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore,\\nshould be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had\\nbeen ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices\\nand adherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union, on the\\nother hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in\\nthe ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any\\ndegree, from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not\\nthe prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a\\ngreater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise\\nagainst the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption\\nfrom death and confiscation, if the final execution of the design,\\nupon an actual appeal to arms, should miscarry? Would this last\\nexpectation have any influence at all, when the probability was\\ncomputed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might\\nhimself be involved in the consequences of the measure, and might be\\nincapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired\\nimpunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary\\nto recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of\\ntreason is limited \\\"to levying war upon the United States, and\\nadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort\\\"; and that\\nby the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds.\\nFourthly. The President can only adjourn the national legislature\\nin the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment.\\nThe British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament.\\nThe governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this\\nState for a limited time; a power which, in certain situations, may\\nbe employed to very important purposes.\\n\\nThe President is to have power, with the advice and consent of\\nthe Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators\\npresent concur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute\\nrepresentative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of\\nhis own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of\\nevery other description. It has been insinuated, that his authority\\nin this respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with\\nforeign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the\\nratification, of Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never\\nheard of, until it was broached upon the present occasion. Every\\njurist [2] of that kingdom, and every other man acquainted with its\\nConstitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of\\nmaking treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plentitude; and\\nthat the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most\\ncomplete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other\\nsanction. The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing\\nitself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the\\nstipulations in a new treaty; and this may have possibly given\\nbirth to the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the\\nobligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary\\ninterposition proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity\\nof adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and\\ncommercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the\\ntreaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new\\nstate of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. In\\nthis respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended\\npower of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign.\\nThe one can perform alone what the other can do only with the\\nconcurrence of a branch of the legislature. It must be admitted,\\nthat, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would\\nexceed that of any State Executive. But this arises naturally from\\nthe sovereign power which relates to treaties. If the Confederacy\\nwere to be dissolved, it would become a question, whether the\\nExecutives of the several States were not solely invested with that\\ndelicate and important prerogative.\\n\\nThe President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors\\nand other public ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme\\nof declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It\\nis a circumstance which will be without consequence in the\\nadministration of the government; and it was far more convenient\\nthat it should be arranged in this manner, than that there should be\\na necessity of convening the legislature, or one of its branches,\\nupon every arrival of a foreign minister, though it were merely to\\ntake the place of a departed predecessor.\\n\\nThe President is to nominate, and, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT\\nOF THE SENATE, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers,\\njudges of the Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the\\nUnited States established by law, and whose appointments are not\\notherwise provided for by the Constitution. The king of Great\\nBritain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor. He\\nnot only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can\\nconfer titles of nobility at pleasure; and has the disposal of an\\nimmense number of church preferments. There is evidently a great\\ninferiority in the power of the President, in this particular, to\\nthat of the British king; nor is it equal to that of the governor\\nof New York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution\\nof the State by the practice which has obtained under it. The power\\nof appointment is with us lodged in a council, composed of the\\ngovernor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly.\\nThe governor CLAIMS, and has frequently EXERCISED, the right of\\nnomination, and is ENTITLED to a casting vote in the appointment.\\nIf he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this\\nrespect equal to that of the President, and exceeds it in the\\narticle of the casting vote. In the national government, if the\\nSenate should be divided, no appointment could be made; in the\\ngovernment of New York, if the council should be divided, the\\ngovernor can turn the scale, and confirm his own nomination. [3]\\nIf we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode\\nof appointment by the President and an entire branch of the national\\nlegislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the\\ngovernor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most\\nfour, and frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same\\ntime consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small\\nnumber of which a council of appointment consists, than the\\nconsiderable number of which the national Senate would consist, we\\ncannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate\\nof this State, in the disposition of offices, must, in practice, be\\ngreatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union.\\n\\nHence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of\\nthe President in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to\\ndetermine whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess\\nmore or less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears\\nyet more unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel\\nwhich has been attempted between him and the king of Great Britain.\\nBut to render the contrast in this respect still more striking, it\\nmay be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude\\ninto a closer group.\\n\\nThe President of the United States would be an officer elected\\nby the people for FOUR years; the king of Great Britain is a\\nperpetual and HEREDITARY prince. The one would be amenable to\\npersonal punishment and disgrace; the person of the other is sacred\\nand inviolable. The one would have a QUALIFIED negative upon the\\nacts of the legislative body; the other has an ABSOLUTE negative.\\nThe one would have a right to command the military and naval forces\\nof the nation; the other, in addition to this right, possesses that\\nof DECLARING war, and of RAISING and REGULATING fleets and armies by\\nhis own authority. The one would have a concurrent power with a\\nbranch of the legislature in the formation of treaties; the other\\nis the SOLE POSSESSOR of the power of making treaties. The one\\nwould have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices;\\nthe other is the sole author of all appointments. The one can\\nconfer no privileges whatever; the other can make denizens of\\naliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the\\nrights incident to corporate bodies. The one can prescribe no rules\\nconcerning the commerce or currency of the nation; the other is in\\nseveral respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity can\\nestablish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can\\nlay embargoes for a limited time, can coin money, can authorize or\\nprohibit the circulation of foreign coin. The one has no particle\\nof spiritual jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and\\ngovernor of the national church! What answer shall we give to those\\nwho would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other?\\nThe same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a\\ngovernment, the whole power of which would be in the hands of the\\nelective and periodical servants of the people, is an aristocracy, a\\nmonarchy, and a despotism.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. A writer in a Pennsylvania paper, under the signature of\\nTAMONY, has asserted that the king of Great Britain owes his\\nprerogative as commander-in-chief to an annual mutiny bill. The\\ntruth is, on the contrary, that his prerogative, in this respect, is\\nimmemorial, and was only disputed, \\\"contrary to all reason and\\nprecedent,\\\" as Blackstone vol. i., page 262, expresses it, by the\\nLong Parliament of Charles I. but by the statute the 13th of Charles\\nII., chap. 6, it was declared to be in the king alone, for that the\\nsole supreme government and command of the militia within his\\nMajesty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by sea and land,\\nand of all forts and places of strength, EVER WAS AND IS the\\nundoubted right of his Majesty and his royal predecessors, kings and\\nqueens of England, and that both or either house of Parliament\\ncannot nor ought to pretend to the same.\\n\\n2. Vide Blackstone's \\\"Commentaries,\\\" vol i., p. 257.\\n\\n3. Candor, however, demands an acknowledgment that I do not think\\nthe claim of the governor to a right of nomination well founded.\\nYet it is always justifiable to reason from the practice of a\\ngovernment, till its propriety has been constitutionally questioned.\\nAnd independent of this claim, when we take into view the other\\nconsiderations, and pursue them through all their consequences, we\\nshall be inclined to draw much the same conclusion.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 39,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Friday, March 14, 1788\",\n          \"Tuesday, March 25, 1788\",\n          \"Tuesday, December 4, 1787\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 71,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Concerning the General Power of Taxation\",\n          \"General Introduction\",\n          \"The Senate Continued\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"paper_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 24,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 85,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 85,\n        \"samples\": [\n          79,\n          1,\n          69\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"venue\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"For the Independent Journal\",\n          \"From the New York Packet\",\n          \"From MCLEAN's Edition, New York\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In the general course of human nature, A POWER OVER A MAN's\\nSUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL. And we can never hope\\nto see realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial\\nfrom the legislative power, in any system which leaves the former\\ndependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the\\nlatter. The enlightened friends to good government in every State,\\nhave seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit\\nprecautions in the State constitutions on this head. Some of these\\nindeed have declared that PERMANENT [1] salaries should be\\nestablished for the judges; but the experiment has in some\\ninstances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite\\nto preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and\\nunequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The plan of the\\nconvention accordingly has provided that the judges of the United\\nStates \\\"shall at STATED TIMES receive for their services a\\ncompensation which shall not be DIMINISHED during their continuance\\nin office.\\\"\\n\\nThis, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible\\nprovision that could have been devised. It will readily be\\nunderstood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the\\nstate of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the\\nConstitution inadmissible. What might be extravagant to-day, might\\nin half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore\\nnecessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary\\nits provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet\\nunder such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body\\nto change the condition of the individual for the worse. A man may\\nthen be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be\\ndeterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less\\neligible situation. The clause which has been quoted combines both\\nadvantages. The salaries of judicial officers may from time to time\\nbe altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the\\nallowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in\\nrespect to him. It will be observed that a difference has been made\\nby the convention between the compensation of the President and of\\nthe judges, That of the former can neither be increased nor\\ndiminished; that of the latter can only not be diminished. This\\nprobably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective\\noffices. As the President is to be elected for no more than four\\nyears, it can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the\\ncommencement of that period, will not continue to be such to its end.\\nBut with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will\\nbe secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially\\nin the early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would\\nbe very sufficient at their first appointment, would become too\\nsmall in the progress of their service.\\n\\nThis provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of\\nprudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together\\nwith the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better\\nprospect of their independence than is discoverable in the\\nconstitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.\\n\\nThe precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the\\narticle respecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached\\nfor malconduct by the House of Representatives, and tried by the\\nSenate; and, if convicted, may be dismissed from office, and\\ndisqualified for holding any other. This is the only provision on\\nthe point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the\\njudicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own\\nConstitution in respect to our own judges.\\n\\nThe want of a provision for removing the judges on account of\\ninability has been a subject of complaint. But all considerate men\\nwill be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced\\nupon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any\\ngood purpose. The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, I\\nbelieve, no place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix\\nthe boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would\\nmuch oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and\\nenmities than advance the interests of justice or the public good.\\nThe result, except in the case of insanity, must for the most part\\nbe arbitrary; and insanity, without any formal or express\\nprovision, may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification.\\n\\nThe constitution of New York, to avoid investigations that must\\nforever be vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the\\ncriterion of inability. No man can be a judge beyond sixty. I\\nbelieve there are few at present who do not disapprove of this\\nprovision. There is no station, in relation to which it is less\\nproper than to that of a judge. The deliberating and comparing\\nfaculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period\\nin men who survive it; and when, in addition to this circumstance,\\nwe consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual\\nvigor, and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the\\nbench, whether more or less numerous, should be in such a situation\\nat the same time, we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of\\nthis sort have little to recommend them. In a republic, where\\nfortunes are not affluent, and pensions not expedient, the\\ndismission of men from stations in which they have served their\\ncountry long and usefully, on which they depend for subsistence, and\\nfrom which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for\\na livelihood, ought to have some better apology to humanity than is\\nto be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. Vide \\\"Constitution of Massachusetts,\\\" chapter 2, section\\nI, article 13.\\n\",\n          \"To the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nAFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the\\nsubsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on\\na new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject\\nspeaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences\\nnothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare\\nof the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many\\nrespects the most interesting in the world. It has been frequently\\nremarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this\\ncountry, by their conduct and example, to decide the important\\nquestion, whether societies of men are really capable or not of\\nestablishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether\\nthey are forever destined to depend for their political\\nconstitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth in the\\nremark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\\nregarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a\\nwrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve\\nto be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\\n\\nThis idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\\npatriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and\\ngood men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice\\nshould be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests,\\nunperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the\\npublic good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than\\nseriously to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations\\naffects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local\\ninstitutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects\\nforeign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little\\nfavorable to the discovery of truth.\\n\\nAmong the most formidable of the obstacles which the new\\nConstitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the\\nobvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist\\nall changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument,\\nand consequence of the offices they hold under the State\\nestablishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men,\\nwho will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of\\ntheir country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of\\nelevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial\\nconfederacies than from its union under one government.\\n\\nIt is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\\nnature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\\nindiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because\\ntheir situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or\\nambitious views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men\\nmay be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted\\nthat much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may\\nhereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless\\nat least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray\\nby preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so\\npowerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the\\njudgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the\\nwrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first\\nmagnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would\\nfurnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much\\npersuaded of their being in the right in any controversy. And a\\nfurther reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the\\nreflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the\\ntruth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists.\\nAmbition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many\\nother motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as\\nwell upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\\nquestion. Were there not even these inducements to moderation,\\nnothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which\\nhas, at all times, characterized political parties. For in\\npolitics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making\\nproselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be\\ncured by persecution.\\n\\nAnd yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we\\nhave already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as\\nin all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of\\nangry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the\\nconduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that\\nthey will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions,\\nand to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of\\ntheir declamations and the bitterness of their invectives. An\\nenlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be\\nstigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and\\nhostile to the principles of liberty. An over-scrupulous jealousy\\nof danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the\\nfault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere\\npretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense\\nof the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that\\njealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\\nenthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow\\nand illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally\\nforgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security\\nof liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed\\njudgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a\\ndangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal\\nfor the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of\\nzeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will\\nteach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to\\nthe introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men\\nwho have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number\\nhave begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people;\\ncommencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.\\n\\nIn the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye,\\nmy fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all\\nattempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a\\nmatter of the utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions\\nother than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You\\nwill, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general\\nscope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the\\nnew Constitution. Yes, my countrymen, I own to you that, after\\nhaving given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion\\nit is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced that this is the\\nsafest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I\\naffect not reserves which I do not feel. I will not amuse you with\\nan appearance of deliberation when I have decided. I frankly\\nacknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you\\nthe reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good\\nintentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\\nprofessions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository\\nof my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be\\njudged of by all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which\\nwill not disgrace the cause of truth.\\n\\nI propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following\\ninteresting particulars:\\n\\nTHE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY\\n\\nTHE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION\\nTO PRESERVE THAT UNION  THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST\\nEQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS\\nOBJECT  THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE\\nPRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT\\nITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION\\nand lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS\\nADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF\\nGOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\\n\\nIn the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\\nsatisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made\\ntheir appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\\n\\nIt may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to\\nprove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved\\non the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and\\none, which it may be imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is,\\nthat we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those\\nwho oppose the new Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too\\ngreat extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity\\nresort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the\\nwhole. [1] This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually\\npropagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open\\navowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to those who are\\nable to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative\\nof an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the\\nUnion. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the\\nadvantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable\\ndangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution.\\nThis shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is\\nheld out in several of the late publications against the new\\nConstitution.\\n\",\n          \"To the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nI PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed\\nExecutive, as they are marked out in the plan of the convention.\\nThis will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the\\nrepresentations which have been made in regard to it.\\n\\nThe first thing which strikes our attention is, that the\\nexecutive authority, with few exceptions, is to be vested in a\\nsingle magistrate. This will scarcely, however, be considered as a\\npoint upon which any comparison can be grounded; for if, in this\\nparticular, there be a resemblance to the king of Great Britain,\\nthere is not less a resemblance to the Grand Seignior, to the khan\\nof Tartary, to the Man of the Seven Mountains, or to the governor of\\nNew York.\\n\\nThat magistrate is to be elected for FOUR years; and is to be\\nre-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think\\nhim worthy of their confidence. In these circumstances there is a\\ntotal dissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain, who is\\nan HEREDITARY monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony\\ndescendible to his heirs forever; but there is a close analogy\\nbetween HIM and a governor of New York, who is elected for THREE\\nyears, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission. If we\\nconsider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a\\ndangerous influence in a single State, than for establishing a like\\ninfluence throughout the United States, we must conclude that a\\nduration of FOUR years for the Chief Magistrate of the Union is a\\ndegree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office, than a\\nduration of THREE years for a corresponding office in a single State.\\n\\nThe President of the United States would be liable to be\\nimpeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other\\nhigh crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would\\nafterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary\\ncourse of law. The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred\\nand inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is\\namenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without\\ninvolving the crisis of a national revolution. In this delicate and\\nimportant circumstance of personal responsibility, the President of\\nConfederated America would stand upon no better ground than a\\ngovernor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of\\nMaryland and Delaware.\\n\\nThe President of the United States is to have power to return a\\nbill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature,\\nfor reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law,\\nif, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both\\nhouses. The king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute\\nnegative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament. The disuse\\nof that power for a considerable time past does not affect the\\nreality of its existence; and is to be ascribed wholly to the\\ncrown's having found the means of substituting influence to\\nauthority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of\\nthe two houses, to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which\\ncould seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national\\nagitation. The qualified negative of the President differs widely\\nfrom this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and tallies\\nexactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of\\nthis State, of which the governor is a constituent part. In this\\nrespect the power of the President would exceed that of the governor\\nof New York, because the former would possess, singly, what the\\nlatter shares with the chancellor and judges; but it would be\\nprecisely the same with that of the governor of Massachusetts, whose\\nconstitution, as to this article, seems to have been the original\\nfrom which the convention have copied.\\n\\nThe President is to be the \\\"commander-in-chief of the army and\\nnavy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States,\\nwhen called into the actual service of the United States. He is to\\nhave power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the\\nUnited States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT; to recommend to the\\nconsideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary\\nand expedient; to convene, on extraordinary occasions, both houses\\nof the legislature, or either of them, and, in case of disagreement\\nbetween them WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF ADJOURNMENT, to adjourn\\nthem to such time as he shall think proper; to take care that the\\nlaws be faithfully executed; and to commission all officers of the\\nUnited States.\\\" In most of these particulars, the power of the\\nPresident will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain\\nand of the governor of New York. The most material points of\\ndifference are these:  First. The President will have only the\\noccasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by\\nlegislative provision may be called into the actual service of the\\nUnion. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have\\nat all times the entire command of all the militia within their\\nseveral jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the\\nPresident would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the\\ngovernor. Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief\\nof the army and navy of the United States. In this respect his\\nauthority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great\\nBritain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to\\nnothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military\\nand naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy;\\nwhile that of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and\\nto the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all which, by\\nthe Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the\\nlegislature. [1] The governor of New York, on the other hand, is\\nby the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its\\nmilitia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States\\nexpressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well\\nof the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those\\nof New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this\\ninstance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than\\ncould be claimed by a President of the United States. Thirdly.\\nThe power of the President, in respect to pardons, would extend to\\nall cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The governor of New York\\nmay pardon in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for\\ntreason and murder. Is not the power of the governor, in this\\narticle, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than\\nthat of the President? All conspiracies and plots against the\\ngovernment, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be\\nscreened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the\\nprerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore,\\nshould be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had\\nbeen ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices\\nand adherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union, on the\\nother hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in\\nthe ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any\\ndegree, from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not\\nthe prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a\\ngreater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise\\nagainst the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption\\nfrom death and confiscation, if the final execution of the design,\\nupon an actual appeal to arms, should miscarry? Would this last\\nexpectation have any influence at all, when the probability was\\ncomputed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might\\nhimself be involved in the consequences of the measure, and might be\\nincapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired\\nimpunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary\\nto recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of\\ntreason is limited \\\"to levying war upon the United States, and\\nadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort\\\"; and that\\nby the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds.\\nFourthly. The President can only adjourn the national legislature\\nin the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment.\\nThe British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament.\\nThe governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this\\nState for a limited time; a power which, in certain situations, may\\nbe employed to very important purposes.\\n\\nThe President is to have power, with the advice and consent of\\nthe Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators\\npresent concur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute\\nrepresentative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of\\nhis own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of\\nevery other description. It has been insinuated, that his authority\\nin this respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with\\nforeign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the\\nratification, of Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never\\nheard of, until it was broached upon the present occasion. Every\\njurist [2] of that kingdom, and every other man acquainted with its\\nConstitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of\\nmaking treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plentitude; and\\nthat the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most\\ncomplete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other\\nsanction. The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing\\nitself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the\\nstipulations in a new treaty; and this may have possibly given\\nbirth to the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the\\nobligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary\\ninterposition proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity\\nof adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and\\ncommercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the\\ntreaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new\\nstate of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. In\\nthis respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended\\npower of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign.\\nThe one can perform alone what the other can do only with the\\nconcurrence of a branch of the legislature. It must be admitted,\\nthat, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would\\nexceed that of any State Executive. But this arises naturally from\\nthe sovereign power which relates to treaties. If the Confederacy\\nwere to be dissolved, it would become a question, whether the\\nExecutives of the several States were not solely invested with that\\ndelicate and important prerogative.\\n\\nThe President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors\\nand other public ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme\\nof declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It\\nis a circumstance which will be without consequence in the\\nadministration of the government; and it was far more convenient\\nthat it should be arranged in this manner, than that there should be\\na necessity of convening the legislature, or one of its branches,\\nupon every arrival of a foreign minister, though it were merely to\\ntake the place of a departed predecessor.\\n\\nThe President is to nominate, and, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT\\nOF THE SENATE, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers,\\njudges of the Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the\\nUnited States established by law, and whose appointments are not\\notherwise provided for by the Constitution. The king of Great\\nBritain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor. He\\nnot only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can\\nconfer titles of nobility at pleasure; and has the disposal of an\\nimmense number of church preferments. There is evidently a great\\ninferiority in the power of the President, in this particular, to\\nthat of the British king; nor is it equal to that of the governor\\nof New York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution\\nof the State by the practice which has obtained under it. The power\\nof appointment is with us lodged in a council, composed of the\\ngovernor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly.\\nThe governor CLAIMS, and has frequently EXERCISED, the right of\\nnomination, and is ENTITLED to a casting vote in the appointment.\\nIf he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this\\nrespect equal to that of the President, and exceeds it in the\\narticle of the casting vote. In the national government, if the\\nSenate should be divided, no appointment could be made; in the\\ngovernment of New York, if the council should be divided, the\\ngovernor can turn the scale, and confirm his own nomination. [3]\\nIf we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode\\nof appointment by the President and an entire branch of the national\\nlegislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the\\ngovernor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most\\nfour, and frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same\\ntime consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small\\nnumber of which a council of appointment consists, than the\\nconsiderable number of which the national Senate would consist, we\\ncannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate\\nof this State, in the disposition of offices, must, in practice, be\\ngreatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union.\\n\\nHence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of\\nthe President in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to\\ndetermine whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess\\nmore or less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears\\nyet more unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel\\nwhich has been attempted between him and the king of Great Britain.\\nBut to render the contrast in this respect still more striking, it\\nmay be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude\\ninto a closer group.\\n\\nThe President of the United States would be an officer elected\\nby the people for FOUR years; the king of Great Britain is a\\nperpetual and HEREDITARY prince. The one would be amenable to\\npersonal punishment and disgrace; the person of the other is sacred\\nand inviolable. The one would have a QUALIFIED negative upon the\\nacts of the legislative body; the other has an ABSOLUTE negative.\\nThe one would have a right to command the military and naval forces\\nof the nation; the other, in addition to this right, possesses that\\nof DECLARING war, and of RAISING and REGULATING fleets and armies by\\nhis own authority. The one would have a concurrent power with a\\nbranch of the legislature in the formation of treaties; the other\\nis the SOLE POSSESSOR of the power of making treaties. The one\\nwould have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices;\\nthe other is the sole author of all appointments. The one can\\nconfer no privileges whatever; the other can make denizens of\\naliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the\\nrights incident to corporate bodies. The one can prescribe no rules\\nconcerning the commerce or currency of the nation; the other is in\\nseveral respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity can\\nestablish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can\\nlay embargoes for a limited time, can coin money, can authorize or\\nprohibit the circulation of foreign coin. The one has no particle\\nof spiritual jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and\\ngovernor of the national church! What answer shall we give to those\\nwho would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other?\\nThe same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a\\ngovernment, the whole power of which would be in the hands of the\\nelective and periodical servants of the people, is an aristocracy, a\\nmonarchy, and a despotism.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. A writer in a Pennsylvania paper, under the signature of\\nTAMONY, has asserted that the king of Great Britain owes his\\nprerogative as commander-in-chief to an annual mutiny bill. The\\ntruth is, on the contrary, that his prerogative, in this respect, is\\nimmemorial, and was only disputed, \\\"contrary to all reason and\\nprecedent,\\\" as Blackstone vol. i., page 262, expresses it, by the\\nLong Parliament of Charles I. but by the statute the 13th of Charles\\nII., chap. 6, it was declared to be in the king alone, for that the\\nsole supreme government and command of the militia within his\\nMajesty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by sea and land,\\nand of all forts and places of strength, EVER WAS AND IS the\\nundoubted right of his Majesty and his royal predecessors, kings and\\nqueens of England, and that both or either house of Parliament\\ncannot nor ought to pretend to the same.\\n\\n2. Vide Blackstone's \\\"Commentaries,\\\" vol i., p. 257.\\n\\n3. Candor, however, demands an acknowledgment that I do not think\\nthe claim of the governor to a right of nomination well founded.\\nYet it is always justifiable to reason from the practice of a\\ngovernment, till its propriety has been constitutionally questioned.\\nAnd independent of this claim, when we take into view the other\\nconsiderations, and pursue them through all their consequences, we\\nshall be inclined to draw much the same conclusion.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 39,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Friday, March 14, 1788\",\n          \"Tuesday, March 25, 1788\",\n          \"Tuesday, December 4, 1787\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 71,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Concerning the General Power of Taxation\",\n          \"General Introduction\",\n          \"The Senate Continued\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"paper_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 24,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 85,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 85,\n        \"samples\": [\n          79,\n          1,\n          69\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"venue\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"For the Independent Journal\",\n          \"From the New York Packet\",\n          \"From MCLEAN's Edition, New York\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"wh1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"wh2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          2,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"whfrac\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.5781958623589,\n        \"min\": -1.6094379124341003,\n        \"max\": 1.0986122886681098,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          -0.6931471805599453,\n          -1.0986122886681098\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

You have yourselves witnessed these things, as I have. it is too soon to assess them; and we who stand in the midst of them and are part of them are less qualified than men of another generation will be to say what they mean, or even what they have been. But some great outstanding facts are unmistakable and constitute, in a sense, part of the public business with which it is our duty to deal. To state them is to set the stage for the legislative and executive action which must grow out of them and which we have yet to shape and determine.A year ago we had sent 145,918 men overseas. Since then we have sent 1,950,513, an average of 162,542 each month, the number in fact rising, in May last, to 245,951, in June to 278,760, in July to 307,182, and continuing to reach similar figures in August and September,in August 289,570 and in September 257,438. No such movement of troops ever took place before, across three thousand miles of sea, followed by adequate equipment and supplies, and carried safely through extraordinary dangers of attack,-dangers which were alike strange and infinitely difficult to guard against. In all this movement only seven hundred and fifty-eight men were lost by enemy attack,six hundred and thirty of whom were upon a single English transport which was sunk near the Orkney Islands.I need not tell you what lay back of this great movement of men and material. It is not invidious to say that back of it lay a supporting organization of the industries of the country and of all its productive activities more complete, more thorough in method and effective in result, more spirited and unanimous in purpose and effort than any other great belligerent had been able to effect. We profited greatly by the experience of the nations which had already been engaged for nearly three years in the exigent and exacting business, their every resource and every executive proficiency taxed to the utmost. We were their pupils. But we learned quickly and acted with a promptness and a readiness of cooperation that justify our great pride that we were able to serve the world with unparalleled energy and quick accomplishment.But it is not the physical scale and executive efficiency of preparation, supply, equipment and despatch that I would dwell upon, but the mettle and quality of the officers and men we sent over and of the sailors who kept the seas, and the spirit of the nation that stood behind them. No soldiers or sailors ever proved themselves more quickly ready for the test of battle or acquitted themselves with more splendid courage and achievement when put to the test. Those of us who played some part in directing the great processes by which the war was pushed irresistibly forward to the final triumph may now forget all that and delight our thoughts with the story of what our men did. Their officers understood the grim and exacting task they had undertaken and performed it with an audacity, efficiency, and unhesitating courage that touch the story of convoy and battle with imperishable distinction at every turn, whether the enterprise were great or small, -from their great chiefs, Pershing and Sims, down to the youngest lieutenant; and their men were worthy of them,-such men as hardly need to be commanded, and go to their terrible adventure blithely and with the quick intelligence of those who know just what it is they would accomplish. I am proud to be the fellowcountryman of men of such stuff and valor. Those of us who stayed at home did our duty; the war could not have been won or the gallant men who fought it given their opportunity to win it otherwise; but for many a long day we shall think ourselves \\\"accurs'd we were not there, and hold our manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought\\\" with these at St. Mihiel or Thierry. The memory of those days of triumphant battle will go with these fortunate men to their graves; and each will have his favorite memory. \\\"Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot, but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day!\\\"What we all thank God for with deepest gratitude is that our men went in force into the line of battle just at the critical moment when the whole fate of the world seemed to hang in the balance and threw their fresh strength into the ranks of freedom in time to turn the whole tide and sweep of the fateful struggle,-turn it once for all, so that thenceforth it was back, back, back for their enemies, always back, never again forward! After that it was only a scant four months before the commanders of the Central Empires knew themselves beaten; and now their very empires are in liquidation!And throughout it all how fine the spirit of the nation was: what unity of purpose, what untiring zeal! What elevation of purpose ran through all its splendid display of strength, its untiring accomplishment! I have said that those of us who stayed at home to do the work of organization and supply will always wish that we had been with the men whom we sustained by our labor; but we can never be ashamed. It has been an inspiring thing to be here in the midst of fine men who had turned aside from every private interest of their own and devoted the whole of their trained capacity to the tasks that supplied the sinews of the whole great undertaking! The patriotism, the unselfishness, the thoroughgoing devotion and distinguished capacity that marked their toilsome labors, day after day, month after month, have made them fit mates and comrades of the men in the trenches and on the sea. And not the men here in Washington only. They have but directed the vast achievement. Throughout innumerable factories, upon innumerable farms, in the depths of coal mines and iron mines and copper mines, wherever the stuffs of industry were to be obtained and prepared, in the shipyards, on the railways, at the docks, on the sea, in every labor that was needed to sustain the battle lines, men have vied with each other to do their part and do it well. They can look any man-at-arms in the face, and say, We also strove to win and gave the best that was in us to make our fleets and armies sure of their triumph!And what shall we say of the women,-of their instant intelligence, quickening every task that they touched; their capacity for organization and cooperation, which gave their action discipline and enhanced the effectiveness of everything they attempted; their aptitude at tasks to which they had. never before set their hands; their utter selfsacrifice alike in what they did and in what they gave? Their contribution to the great result is beyond appraisal. They have added a new lustre to the annals of American womanhood.The least tribute we can pay them is to make them the equals of men in political rights as they have proved themselves their equals in every field of practical work they have entered, whether for themselves or for their country. These great days of completed achievement would be sadly marred were we to omit that act of justice. Besides the immense practical services they have rendered the women of the country have been the moving spirits in the systematic economies by which our people have voluntarily assisted to supply the suffering peoples of the world and the armies upon every front with food and everything else that we had that might serve the common cause. The details of such a story can never be fully written, but we carry them at our hearts and thank God that we can say that we are the kinsmen of such.And now we are sure of the great triumph for which every sacrifice was made. It has come, come in its completeness, and with the pride and inspiration of these days of achievement quick within us, we turn to the tasks of peace again,-a peace secure against the violence of irresponsible monarchs and ambitious military coteries and made ready for a new order, for new foundations of justice and fair dealing.We are about to give order and organization to this peace not only for ourselves but for the other peoples of the world as well, so far as they will suffer us to serve them. It is international justice that we seek, not domestic safety merely. Our thoughts have dwelt of late upon Europe, upon Asia, upon the near and the far East, very little upon the acts of peace and accommodation that wait to be performed at our own doors. While we are adjusting our relations with the rest of the world is it not of capital importance that we should clear away all grounds of misunderstanding with our immediate neighbors and give proof of the friendship we really feel? I hope that the members of the Senate will permit me to speak once more of the unratified treaty of friendship and adjustment with the Republic of Colombia. I very earnestly urge upon them an early and favorable action upon that vital matter. I believe that they will feel, with me, that the stage of affairs is now set for such action as will be not only just but generous and in the spirit of the new age upon which we have so happily entered.So far as our domestic affairs are concerned the problem of our return to peace is a problem of economic and industrial readjustment. That problem is less serious for us than it may turn out too he for the nations which have suffered the disarrangements and the losses of war longer than we. Our people, moreover, do not wait to be coached and led. They know their own business, are quick and resourceful at every readjustment, definite in purpose, and self-reliant in action. Any leading strings we might seek to put them in would speedily become hopelessly tangled because they would pay no attention to them and go their own way. All that we can do as their legislative and executive servants is to mediate the process of change here, there, and elsewhere as we may. I have heard much counsel as to the plans that should be formed and personally conducted to a happy consummation, but from no quarter have I seen any general scheme of \\\"reconstruction\\\" emerge which I thought it likely we could force our spirited business men and self-reliant laborers to accept with due pliancy and obedience.While the war lasted we set up many agencies by which to direct the industries of the country in the services it was necessary for them to render, by which to make sure of an abundant supply of the materials needed, by which to check undertakings that could for the time be dispensed with and stimulate those that were most serviceable in war, by which to gain for the purchasing departments of the Government a certain control over the prices of essential articles and materials, by which to restrain trade with alien enemies, make the most of the available shipping, and systematize financial transactions, both public and private, so that there would be no unnecessary conflict or confusion,-by which, in short, to put every material energy of the country in harness to draw -the common load and make of us one team in the accomplishment of a great task. But the moment we knew the armistice to have been signed we took the harness off. Raw materials upon which the Government had kept its hand for fear there should not be enough for the industries that supplied the armies have been released and put into the general market again. Great industrial plants whose whole output and machinery had been taken over for the uses of the Government have been set free to return to the uses to which they were put before the war. It has not been possible to remove so readily or so quickly the control of foodstuffs and of shipping, because the world has still to be fed from our granaries and the ships are still needed to send supplies to our men overseas and to bring the men back as fast as the disturbed conditions on the other side of the water permit; but even there restraints are being relaxed as much as possible and more and more as the weeks go byNever before have there been agencies in existence in this country which knew so much of the field of supply, of labor, and of industry as the War Industries Board, the War Trade Board, the Labor Department, the Food Administration, and the Fuel Administration have known since their labors became thoroughly systematized; and they have not been isolated agencies; they have been directed by men who represented the permanent Departments of the Government and so have been the centres of unified and cooperative action. It has been the policy of the Executive, therefore, since the armistice was assured (which is in effect a complete submission of the enemy) to put the knowledge of these bodies at the disposal of the business men of the country and to offer their intelligent mediation at every point and in every matter where it was desired. It is surprising how fast the process of return to a peace footing has moved in the three weeks since the fighting stopped. It promises to outrun any inquiry that may be instituted and any aid that may be offered. It will not be easy to direct it any better than it will direct itself. The American business man is of quick initiative.The ordinary and normal processes of private initiative will not, however, provide immediate employment for all of the men of our returning armies. Those who are of trained capacity, those who are skilled workmen, those who have acquired familiarity with established businesses, those who are ready and willing to go to the farms, all those whose aptitudes are known or will be sought out by employers will find no difficulty, it is safe to say, in finding place and employment. But there will be others who will be at a loss where to gain a livelihood unless pains are taken to guide them and put them in the way of work. There will be a large floating residuum of labor which should not be left wholly to shift for itself. It seems to me important, therefore, that the development of public works of every sort should be promptly resumed, in order that opportunities should be created for unskilled labor in particular, and that plans should be made for such developments of our unused lands and our natural resources as we have hitherto lacked stirnulation to undertake.I particularly direct your attention to the very practical plans which the Secretary of the Interior has developed in his annual report and before your Committees for the reclamation of arid, swamp, and cutover lands which might, if the States were willing and able to cooperate, redeem some three hundred million acres of land for cultivation. There are said to be fifteen or twenty million acres of land in the West, at present arid, for whose reclamation water is available, if properly conserved. There are about two hundred and thirty million acres from which the forests have been cut but which have never yet been cleared for the plow and which lie waste and desolate. These lie scattered all over the Union. And there are nearly eighty million acres of land that lie under swamps or subject to periodical overflow or too wet for anything but grazing, which it is perfectly feasible to drain and protect and redeem. The Congress can at once direct thousands of the returning soldiers to the reclamation of the arid lands which it has already undertaken, if it will but enlarge the plans and appropriations which it has entrusted to the Department of the Interior. It is possible in dealing with our unused land to effect a great rural and agricultural development which will afford the best sort of opportunity to men who want to help themselves' and the Secretary of the Interior has thought the possible methods out in a way which is worthy of your most friendly attention.I have spoken of the control which must yet for a while, perhaps for a long long while, be exercised over shipping because of the priority of service to which our forces overseas are entitled and which should also be accorded the shipments which are to save recently liberated peoples from starvation and many devasted regions from permanent ruin. May I not say a special word about the needs of Belgium and northern France? No sums of money paid by way of indemnity will serve of themselves to save them from hopeless disadvantage for years to come. Something more must be done than merely find the money. If they had money and raw materials in abundance to-morrow they could not resume their place in the industry of the world to-morrow,-the very important place they held before the flame of war swept across them. Many of their factories are razed to the ground. Much of their machinery is destroyed or has been taken away. Their people are scattered and many of their best workmen are dead. Their markets will be taken by others, if they are not in some special way assisted to rebuild their factories and replace their lost instruments of manufacture. They should not be left to the vicissitudes of the sharp competition for materials and for industrial facilities which is now to set in. I hope, therefore, that the Congress will not be unwilling, if it should become necessary, to grant to some such agency as the War Trade Board the right to establish priorities of export and supply for the benefit of these people whom we have been so happy to assist in saving from the German terror and whom we must not now thoughtlessly leave to shift for themselves in a pitiless competitive market.For the steadying, and facilitation of our own domestic business readjustments nothing is more important than the immediate determination of the taxes that are to be levied for 1918, 1919, and 1920. As much of the burden of taxation must be lifted from business as sound methods of financing the Government will permit, and those who conduct the great essential industries of the country must be told as exactly as possible what obligations to the Government they will be expected to meet in the years immediately ahead of them. It will be of serious consequence to the country to delay removing all uncertainties in this matter a single day longer than the right processes of debate justify. It is idle to talk of successful and confident business reconstruction before those uncertainties are resolved.If the war had continued it would have been necessary to raise at least eight billion dollars by taxation payable in the year 1919; but the war has ended and I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury that it will be safe to reduce the amount to six billions. An immediate rapid decline in the expenses of the Government is not to be looked for. Contracts made for war supplies will, indeed, be rapidly cancelled and liquidated, but their immediate liquidation will make heavy drains on the Treasury for the months just ahead of us. The maintenance of our forces on the other side of the sea is still necessary. A considerable proportion of those forces must remain in Europe during the period of occupation, and those which are brought home will be transported and demobilized at heavy expense for months to come. The interest on our war debt must of course be paid and provision made for the retirement of the obligations of the Government which represent it. But these demands will of course fall much below what a continuation of military operations would have entailed and six billions should suffice to supply a sound foundation for the financial operations of the year.I entirely concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending that the two billions needed in addition to the four billions provided by existing law be obtained from the profits which have accrued and shall accrue from war contracts and distinctively war business, but that these taxes be confined to the war profits accruing in 1918, or in 1919 from business originating in war contracts. I urge your acceptance of his recommendation that provision be made now, not subsequently, that the taxes to be paid in 1920 should be reduced from six to four billions. Any arrangements less definite than these would add elements of doubt and confusion to the critical period of industrial readjustment through which the country must now immediately pass, and which no true friend of the nation's essential business interests can afford to be responsible for creating or prolonging. Clearly determined conditions, clearly and simply charted, are indispensable to the economic revival and rapid industrial development which may confidently be expected if we act now andsweep all interrogation points away.I take it for granted that the Congress will carry out the naval programme which was undertaken before we entered the war. The Secretary of the Navy has submitted to your Committees for authorization that part of the programme which covers the building plans of the next three years. These plans have been prepared along the lines and in accordance with the policy which the Congress established, not under the exceptional conditions of the war, but with the intention of adhering to a definite method of development for the navy. I earnestly recommend the uninterrupted pursuit of that policy. It would clearly be unwise for us to attempt to adjust our programmes to a future world policy as yet undetermined.The question which causes me the greatest concern is the question of the policy to be adopted towards the railroads. I frankly turn to you for counsel upon it. I have no confident judgment of my own. I do not see how any thoughtful man can have who knows anything of the complexity of the problem. It is a problem which must be studied, studied immediately, and studied without bias or prejudice. Nothing can be gained by becoming partisans of any particular plan of settlement.It was necessary that the administration of the railways should be taken over by the Government so long as the war lasted. It would have been impossible otherwise to establish and carry through under a single direction the necessary priorities of shipment. It would have been impossible otherwise to combine maximum production at the factories and mines and farms with the maximum possible car supply to take the products to the ports and markets; impossible to route troop shipments and freight shipments without regard to the advantage or-disadvantage of the roads employed; impossible to subordinate, when necessary, all questions of convenience to the public necessity; impossible to give the necessary financial support to the roads from the public treasury. But all these necessities have now been served, and the question is, What is best for the railroads and for the public in the future?Exceptional circumstances and exceptional methods of administration were not needed to convince us that the railroads were not equal to the immense tasks of transportation imposed upon them by the rapid and continuous development of the industries of the country. We knew that already. And we knew that they were unequal to it partly because their full cooperation was rendered impossible by law and their competition made obligatory, so that it has been impossible to assign to them severally the traffic which could best be carried by their respective lines in the interest of expedition and national economy.We may hope, I believe, for the formal conclusion of the war by treaty by the time Spring has come. The twentyone months to which the present control of the railways is limited after formal proclamation of peace shall have been made will run at the farthest, I take it for granted, only to the January of 1921. The full equipment of the railways which the federal administration had planned could not be completed within any such period. The present law does not permit the use of the revenues of the several roads for the execution of such plans except by formal contract with their directors, some of whom will consent while some will not, and therefore does not afford sufficient authority to undertake improvements upon the scale upon which it would be necessary to undertake them. Every approach to this difficult subject-matter of decision brings us face to face, therefore, with this unanswered question: What is it right that we should do with the railroads, in the interest of the public and in fairness to their owners?Let me say at once that I have no answer ready. The only thing that is perfectly clear to me is that it is not fair either to the public or to the owners of the railroads to leave the question unanswered and that it will presently become my duty to relinquish control of the roads, even before the expiration of the statutory period, unless there should appear some clear prospect in the meantime of a legislative solution. Their release would at least produce one element of a solution, namely certainty and a quick stimulation of private initiative.I believe that it will be serviceable for me to set forth as explicitly as possible the alternative courses that lie open to our choice. We can simply release the roads and go back to the old conditions of private management, unrestricted competition, and multiform regulation by both state and federal authorities; or we can go to the opposite extreme and establish complete government control, accompanied, if necessary, by actual government ownership; or we can adopt an intermediate course of modified private control, under a more unified and affirmative public regulation and under such alterations of the law as will permit wasteful competition to be avoided and a considerable degree of unification of administration to be effected, as, for example, by regional corporations under which the railways of definable areas would be in effect combined in single systems.The one conclusion that I am ready to state with confidence is that it would be a disservice alike to the country and to the owners of the railroads to return to the old conditions unmodified. Those are conditions of restraint without development. There is nothing affirmative or helpful about them. What the country chiefly needs is that all its means of transportation should be developed, its railways, its waterways, its highways, and its countryside roads. Some new element of policy, therefore, is absolutely necessary--necessary for the service of the public, necessary for the release of credit to those who are administering the railways, necessary for the protection of their security holders. The old policy may be changed much or little, but surely it cannot wisely be left as it was. I hope that the Congress will have a complete and impartial study of the whole problem instituted at once and prosecuted as rapidly as possible. I stand ready and anxious to release the roads from the present control and I must do so at a very early date if by waiting until the statutory limit of time is reached I shall be merely prolonging the period of doubt and uncertainty which is hurtful to every interest concerned.I welcome this occasion to announce to the Congress my purpose to join in Paris the representatives of the governments with which we have been associated in the war against the Central Empires for the purpose of discussing with them the main features of the treaty of peace. I realize the great inconveniences that will attend my leaving the country, particularly at this time, but the conclusion that it was my paramount duty to go has been forced upon me by considerations which I hope will seem as conclusive to you as they have seemed to me.The Allied governments have accepted the bases of peace which I outlined to the Congress on the eighth of January last, as the Central Empires also have, and very reasonably desire my personal counsel in their interpretation and application, and it is highly desirable that I should give it in order that the sincere desire of our Government to contribute without selfish purpose of any kind to settlements that will be of common benefit to all the nations concerned may be made fully manifest. The peace settlements which are now to be agreed upon are of transcendent importance both to us and to the rest of the world, and I know of no business or interest which should take precedence of them. The gallant men of our armed forces on land and sea have consciously fought for the ideals which they knew to be the ideals of their country; I have sought to express those ideals; they have accepted my statements of them as the substance of their own thought and purpose, as the associated governments have accepted them; I owe it to them to see to it, so far as in me lies, that no false or mistaken interpretation is put upon them, and no possible effort omitted to realize them. It is now my duty to play my full part in making good what they offered their life's blood to obtain. I can think of no call to service which could transcend this.I shall be in close touch with you and with affairs on this side the water, and you will know all that I do. At my request, the French and English governments have absolutely removed the censorship of cable news which until within a fortnight they had maintained and there is now no censorship whatever exercised at this end except upon attempted trade communications with enemy countries. It has been necessary to keep an open wire constantly available between Paris and the Department of State and another between France and the Department of War. In order that this might be done with the least possible interference with the other uses of the cables, I have temporarily taken over the control of both cables in order that they may be used as a single system. I did so at the advice of the most experienced cable officials, and I hope that the results will justify my hope that the news of the next few months may pass with the utmost freedom and with the least possible delay from each side of the sea to the other.May I not hope, Gentlemen of the Congress, that in the delicate tasks I shall have to perform on the other side of the sea, in my efforts truly and faithfully to interpret the principles and purposes of the country we love, I may have the encouragement and the added strength of your united support? I realize the magnitude and difficulty of the duty I am undertaking; I am poignantly aware of its grave responsibilities. I am the servant of the nation. I can have no private thought or purpose of my own in performing such an errand. I go to give the best that is in me to the common settlements which I must now assist in arriving at in conference with the other working heads of the associated governments. I shall count upon your friendly countenance and encouragement. I shall not be inaccessible. The cables and the wireless will render me available for any counsel or service you may desire of me, and I shall be happy in the thought that I am constantly in touch with the weighty matters of domestic policy with which we shall have to deal. I shall make my absence as brief as possible and shall hope to return with the happy assurance that it has been possible to translate into action the great ideals for which America has striven.\",\n          \"The period for a new election of a citizen to administer the Executive Government of the United States being not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with that important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed to decline being considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made.\\n\\nI beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that this resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the considerations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that in withdrawing the tender of service, which silence in my Situation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both.\\n\\nThe acceptance of and continuance hitherto in the office to which your suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at liberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this previous to the last election had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence impelled me to abandon the idea. I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety, and am persuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my services, that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire.\\n\\nThe impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust I will only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed toward the organization and administration of the Government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable, Not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and every day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.\\n\\nIn looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the career of my political life my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me, and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an instructive example in our annals that under circumstances in which the passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead; amidst appearances sometimes dubious; vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging; in situations in which not unfrequently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts and a guaranty of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free Constitution which is the work of your hands may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these States, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\\n\\nHere, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare which can not end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn contemplation and to recommend to your frequent review some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you with the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget as an encouragement to it your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar occasion.\\n\\nInterwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment.\\n\\nThe unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you. It is justly so, for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence, the support of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth, as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.\\n\\nFor this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\\n\\nBut these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the union of the whole.\\n\\nThe North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected by the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of the latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial enterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the North, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes in different ways to nourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior communications by land and water will more and more find, a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth and comfort, and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically precarious.\\n\\nWhile, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular interest in union, all the parts combined can not fail to find in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater resource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations, and what is of inestimable value, they must derive from union an exemption from those broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict neighboring countries not tied together by the same governments, which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which opposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate and imbitter. Hence, likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments which, under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is that your union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other.\\n\\nThese considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the union as a primary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common government can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To listen to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are authorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will afford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands.\\n\\nIn contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western-- whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our Western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in the negotiation by the Executive and in the unanimous ratification by the Senate of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States unfriendly to their interests in regard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties that with Great Britain and that with Spain--which secure to them everything they could desire in respect to our foreign relations toward confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there are, who would sever them from their brethren and connect them with aliens?\\n\\nTo the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts can be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of Government better calculated than your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This Government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. But the constitution which at any time exists till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government.\\n\\nAll obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community, and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to snake the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans, digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.\\n\\nHowever combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying. afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\\n\\nToward the preservation of your Government and the permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority, but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will impair the energy of the system, and thus to undermine what can not be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country; that facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion exposes to perpetual change, from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember especially that for the efficient management of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. Liberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else than a name where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\\n\\nI have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.\\n\\nThis spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.\\n\\nThe alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual, and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.\\n\\nWithout looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\\n\\nIt serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-rounded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another; foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passion. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.\\n\\nThere is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose; and there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.\\n\\nIt is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those intrusted with its administration to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into different depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\\n\\nOf all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness--these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\\n\\nIt is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric? Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions &#39;for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened.\\n\\nAs a very important source of strength and security, cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but remembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burthen which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives; but it is necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that toward the payment of debts there must be revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that thee intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the Government in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.\\n\\nObserve good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct. And can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at least, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\\n\\nIn the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others should be excluded, and that in place of them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated. The nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur.\\n\\nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation prompted by ill will and resentment sometimes impels to war the government contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would reject. At other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility, instigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\\n\\nSo, likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld; and it gives to ambitions, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with popularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.\\n\\nAs avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter. Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence ( I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy, to be useful, must be impartial, else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their interests.\\n\\nThe great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.\\n\\nEurope has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.\\n\\nOur detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.\\n\\nWhy forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\\n\\nIt is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world, so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs that honesty is always. the best policy. I repeat, therefore, let those engagements be unwise to extend them.\\n\\nTaking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.\\n\\nHarmony, liberal intercourse with all nations are recommended by policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand, neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of things; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce, but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in order to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the Government to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another; that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\\n\\nIn offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and affectionate friend I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual current of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good--that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism-- this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they have been dictated.\\n\\nHow far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated the public records and other evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To myself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least believed myself to be guided by them.\\n\\nIn relation to the still subsisting war in Europe my proclamation of the 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice and by that of your representatives in both Houses of Congress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\\n\\nAfter deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could obtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the circumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and interest to take, a neutral position. Having taken it, I determined as far as should depend upon me to maintain it with moderation, perseverance, and firmness.\\n\\nThe considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, according to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.\\n\\nThe duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without anything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity toward other nations.\\n\\nThe inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be referred to your own reflections and experience. With me a predominant motive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and mature its yet recent institutions, and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\\n\\nThough in reviewing the incidents of my Administration I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence, and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\\n\\nRelying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by that fervent love toward it which is so natural to a man who views in it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the midst of my fellow-citizens the benign influence of good laws under a free government--the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.\",\n          \"The President: How do you do? I have a brief opening statement here before I take your questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan sent to the Congress a request to raise the debt ceiling to $985 billion. This represents a dramatic jump of $50 billion over the previous debt ceiling. The administration took this action with great regret, because it's clear that the massive deficits our government runs is one of the root causes of our profound economic problems, and for too many years this process has come too easily for us. We've lived beyond our means and then financed our extravagance on the backs of the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clear message I received in the election campaign is that we must gain control of this inflationary monster.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me briefly review for the American people what we've already done. Within moments of taking the oath of office, I placed a freeze on the hiring of civilian employees in the Federal Government. Two days later I issued an order to cut down on government travel, reduce the number of consultants to the government, stopped the procurement of certain items, and called on my appointees to exercise restraint in their own offices. Yesterday I announced the elimination of remaining Federal controls on U.S. oil production and marketing.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday I'm announcing two more actions to reduce the size of the Federal Government.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, I'm taking major steps toward the elimination of the Council on Wage and Price Stability. This Council has been a failure. It has been totally ineffective in controlling inflation, and it's imposed unnecessary burdens on labor and business. Therefore, I am now ending the wage and price program of the Council. I am eliminating the staff that carries out its wage/pricing activities, and I'm asking Congress to rescind its budget, saving the taxpayers some $1% million a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy second decision today is a directive ordering key Federal agencies to freeze pending regulations for 60 days. This action gives my administration time to start a new regulatory oversight process and also prevents certain last-minute regulatory decisions of the previous administration, the so-called midnight regulations, from taking effect without proper review and approval.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us should remember that the Federal Government is not some mysterious institution comprised of buildings, files, and paper. The people are the government. What we create we ought to be able to control. I do not intend to make wildly skyrocketing deficits and runaway government simple facts of life in this administration. As I've said, our ills have come upon us over several decades, and they will not go away in days or weeks or months. But I want the American people to know that we have begun.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I'll be happy to take your questions. Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International].\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, will your policy toward Iran be one of revenge or reconciliation? And will the United States honor the recent commitments to Iran, especially since you approved of most of them during the campaign?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, I'm certainly not thinking of revenge, and I don't know whether reconciliation would be possible with the present government, or absence of a government, in Iran.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that the United States will honor the obligations. As a matter of fact, the most important of those were already put into effect by the preceding administration in negotiating the release. We are, however, studying, because there were four major agreements and there were nine Executive orders, and we are studying thoroughly what is a pretty complex matter, we've discovered, with regard to whether they are in keeping with international and our own national laws. And so, I won't be able to really answer your questions on specifics until we've completed that study.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, the Treasury Secretary said Monday that your budget cuts will be of a much higher magnitude than most people thought they would be. You said they would be across the board. Now that you've had some time to study the budget, can you say where these cuts will be made, what program will feel the cuts the most?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: They'll be made every place. Maybe across the board was the wrong decision, although it describes it. What I meant was that no one is exempt from being looked at for areas in which we can make cuts in spending.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yes, they probably are going to be bigger than anyone has ever attempted, because this administration did not come here to be a caretaker government and just hope we could go along the same way and maybe do it a little better. We think the time has come where there has to be a change of direction of this country, and it's going to begin with reducing government spending.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, in your welcoming address to the freed Americans, you sounded a warning of swift and effective retribution in future terrorist situations. What kind of action are you prepared to take to back up this hard rhetoric?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, that's a question that I don't think you can or should answer as to specifics. This is a big and it's a powerful nation. It has a lot of options open to it, and to try and specify now just particularly what you should do I think is one of the things that's been wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople have gone to bed in some of these countries that have done these things to us in the past confident that they can go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and the United States wouldn't have taken any action. What I meant by that phrase was that anyone who does these things, violates our rights in the future, is not going to be able to go to bed with that confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt [Walter Rodgers, Associated Press Radio].\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, you campaigned rather vociferously against the SALT II treaty, saying it was slightly toward the Soviet Union. Yet I noticed your Secretary of State, Mr. Haig, now seems to suggest that for the time being, at least, the United States will abide by the limits of the SALT II treaty and he hopes the Soviet Union will, too. How long do you intend that the United States should abide by the terms of a SALT agreement which you consider inequitable, and what do you consider its greatest inequities to be?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, the SALT treaty, first of all, I think, permits a continued buildup on both sides of strategic nuclear weapons but, in the main thing, authorizes an immediate increase in large numbers of Soviet warheads. There is no verification as to the number of warheads on the missile, no method for us to do this.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't think that a treaty\\u2014SALT means strategic arms limitation\\u2014that actually permits a buildup, on both sides, of strategic nuclear weapons can properly be called that. And I have said that when we can-and I am willing for our people to go in to negotiate or, let me say, discussions leading to negotiations\\u2014that we should start negotiating on the basis of trying to effect an actual reduction in the numbers of nuclear weapons. That would then be real strategic arms limitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I happen to believe, also, that you can't sit down at a table and just negotiate that unless you take into account, in consideration at that table all the other things that are going on. In other words, I believe in linkage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam [Sam Donaldson, ABC News].\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, what do you see as the long-range intentions of the Soviet Union? Do you think, for instance, the Kremlin is bent on world domination that might lead to a continuation of the cold war, or do you think that under other circumstances detente is possible?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, so far detente's been a one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its own aims. I don't have to think of an answer as to what I think their intentions are; they have repeated it. I know of no leader of the Soviet Union since the revolution, and including the present leadership, that has not more than once repeated in the various Communist congresses they hold their determination that their goal must be the promotion of world revolution and a one-world Socialist or Communist state, whichever word you want to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as long as they do that and as long as they, at the same time, have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in order to attain that, and that is moral, not immoral, and we operate on a different set of standards, I think when you do business with them, even at a detente, you keep that in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, what's your opinion of American companies that now want to resume business with Iran?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: My opinion of American companies that want to resume business with Iran? I hope they're going to do it by long distance. [Laughter] We wouldn't want to go back to having just a different cast of characters, but the same show going on. [Laughter]\\r\\n\\r\\nI can understand that, particularly in the field of energy, their wanting to do that, but we are urging the people to think long and hard before they travel to Iran, because we don't think their safety can be guaranteed there.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, three Americans are still incarcerated in Vietnam [Iran]. Can you tell us the status of their cases and whether the administration is doing anything to get them back?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: I have told our people about those three. They knew about them, of course, but I've told them that, yes, we continue and we want to get them back, also.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I know I've been staying down front here too much. I've got to prove I can look at the back rows there. You, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Okay. Mr. President, some administrative officials have promised adherence to the civil rights laws which are on the books, but there has been considerable discussion about dismantling the affirmative action aspect that gives those laws, to some people, greater meaning. And I'm wondering, Mr. President, that if there will be a retreat in the Federal Government on the government's advocacy of affirmative action programs generally and in Federal hiring of blacks and Hispanics specifically?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: No, there will be no retreat. This administration is going to be dedicated to equality. I think we've made great progress in the civil rights field. I think there are some things, however, that may not be as useful as they once were or that may even be distorted in the practice, such as some affirmative action programs becoming quota systems. And I'm old enough to remember when quotas existed in the United States for the purpose of discrimination, and I don't want to see that happen again.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, when and how will you seek the decontrol of natural gas prices? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, we haven't dealt with that problem yet. We thought oil would do for a starter. But I can't really answer your question. That will be a matter for discussion in future Cabinet meetings. Lou [Lou Cannon, Washington Post].\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, during the campaign you repeatedly talked about the unfairness of the grain embargo, as you saw it. Do you have second thoughts now, or will you lift the grain embargo?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, with the grain embargo, my quarrel with it from the first was that I thought it was asking only one group of Americans to participate, the farmers.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou only have two choices with an embargo: You either lift it, or you broaden it. And we have not made a decision except that, at the request of Secretary of Agriculture John Block, I have taken the matter of the embargo out of, you might say, the discussions of the National Security Council, and it, next week, is on the agenda for a full Cabinet meeting as to what our course will be. So, I can't answer what we do about it until next week.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I say, it was asking one group of Americans to bear the burden and, I have always thought, was more of a kind of gesture than it was something real.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, ma'am.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, what will you do to honor the request from Atlanta officials for you and the Federal Government to intercede in the Atlanta case of 17 missing black children?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Just a few minutes before I came in here, that message was handed to me that the Atlanta mayor wanted to talk, and we are going to get someone in touch with him immediately. Now, you recognize, of course, that possibly civil rights would be the only basis upon which we could have any jurisdiction down there in this. For FBI, for example, on any other thing, there's been no evidence of crossing State lines or anything. And yet we want to be helpful, because that is a most tragic case, and so we will be meeting on that very shortly. \\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, when the Jamaican Prime Minister was here yesterday, Mr. Seaga, he suggested publicly that now might be a good time for you, as the new President, to have a foreign policy initiative for Latin America and for the Caribbean. Do you intend to follow that suggestion, and if so, how would your policies differ from those of former President Carter?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, I think we've seen a great reverse in the Caribbean situation, and it came about through Prime Minister Seaga's election. It was the turnover or turn-around of a nation that had gone, certainly, in the direction of the Communist movement; it was a protege of Castro. And his election was greeted by me with great enthusiasm, because it represented the people by their vote, having experienced that kind of government, turned another direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I think this opens the door for us to have a policy in the Mediterranean of bringing them back in\\u2014those countries that might have started in that direction\\u2014or keeping them in the Western World, in the free world. And so, we are looking forward to cooperation with Prime Minister Seaga.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, I think you meant \\\"Caribbean\\\" in that last answer rather than \\\"Mediterranean.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: What'd I say?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: \\\"Mediterranean.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Oh. I meant \\\"Caribbean.\\\" I'm sorry.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: What do you intend to do, Mr. President, about the draft registration law that was passed during President Carter's administration? And in view of your opposition to it in the campaign, how is that consistent with your avowed intention to strengthen our national defenses?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, to answer the last part first, I just didn't feel that the advance registration, on all the evidence we could get, would materially speed up the process if an emergency required the draft. It did create a bureaucracy. It caused, certainly, some unrest and dissatisfaction. And we were told that it would only be a matter of several days if we had to call up in a draft, that we could do that several days earlier with the registration than we would be able if there was no registration at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is one that's something to be looked at further down. I've only been here 9 days, and most of these 9 days have been spent in Cabinet meetings on the economy, getting ready to send our package up to the Hill. And so, I just have to tell you that we will be dealing with that, meet with that, and make a decision on what to do with it down the road someplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nGary [Gary Schuster, Detroit News].\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, speaking of your economic package, can you give us your thoughts on an effective date for the tax cuts that you plan to recommend in your economic recovery plan, and specifying whether you prefer one effective date for business and another for personal cuts or whether you'd like to combine them?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: I'd like to see it all go forward all at once. As to date, I know there's been talk about whether it should be retroactive back or whether it should be as of that minute. That, to me, isn't as important as getting for individuals the principle of a 10-percent cut for each of 3 years in place and the business taxes, also, so that we can all look forward with some confidence of stability in the program. And we're going to strive for that. And I can't really answer you about what the date will be until we submit the package.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, I know you said earlier that you were not thinking of revenge toward Iran. But does that preclude any punishment whatsoever for what they've done?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, again, I have to ask your forbearance and wait until we've finished our study of this whole situation as to what we're going to do. I don't think any of us have a friendly feeling toward the people that have done what they have done. But I think it's too complex for me to answer until we've had time to really study this.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, just one follow-up. Would you go so far as to encourage American businesses to resume commercial trade with Iran?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: At this point, no.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, do you intend to follow through with your campaign pledges to abolish the Departments of Energy and Education?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: I have not retreated from that at all. Yes. The process, however, that I have asked for is for both Secretary Bell of Education and Secretary Jim Edwards of Energy to reorganize, to produce the most effective streamlining of their Departments that they can\\u2014in Education, to look at the appropriate role of the Federal Government in education, if there is one, and to report back. And then we will decide, making our recommendations. Much the same thing holds true with the Department of Energy. The reason for this being that while they were new Cabinet-level agencies, they incorporated government functions and programs that had been going on in them, and they came under that umbrella. And we have to find out which of those functions that have been a Federal Government function continue and where they would best fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, yes, I'm determined, and I believe that it was wrong to have created the two agencies to begin with.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, during the campaign your chief farm spokesman put you on record as favoring, for the time being, continuation of the dairy price support level where it had been. Within the last couple of days, your budget director and your Secretary of Agriculture have indicated that the dairy program is too expensive and should be cut back. Could you reconcile those differences of approach for us?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, I could only tell you that this, again, is something to wait for the next Cabinet meeting. All of these things are worked out between the appropriate Cabinet members and our Director of OMB, and then they come to the Cabinet for full discussion so that others who have an interest in this can have their input. And so, I can't answer you, because that has not yet come to the Cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, Iran and the Soviet Union share a long border in a region vital to the future stability of the world. Given the anti-U.S. sentiment there, how do you best think the United States can ensure the stability of the region, the Persian Gulf region?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Of the\\u2014you said Iran, the border between Iran and the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I think one of the first things that has to happen for stability, has got to be, in Iran itself, to establish a government that can speak as a government for Iran. And part of our problem in all these long 444 days has been the inability of anyone seemingly to speak for that nation, to have a government. Now, I think that any country would want to help another if they really showed an intent to have a government that would abide by international law and do what they could to help them in that regard. But until such a thing appears apparent there, I don't know that there's anything we can do.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, if it's your intention to signal the world that this country will respond with swift retribution in cases of international terrorism in the future, why is it your policy not to retaliate against Iran?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Well, what good would just revenge do, and what form would that take? I don't think revenge is worthy of us. On the other hand, I don't think we act as if this never happened. And I'd rather wait until, as I say, we complete this study.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho said\\u2014I know I've been on this side too long, but someone said, \\\"Por favor.\\\" [Laughter]\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, still I am impressed when I listened the other day, \\\"Viva la roja, la blanca, y azul.\\\" Mr. President, it is true that when Hispanics are given the opportunity to serve this country, they serve the country with diligence and dispatch. In view of this undisputed fact, when are you going to appoint Hispanic Americans to serve in your administration in policy-making positions?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: We are definitely recruiting and definitely trying to do that. I want an administration that will be representative of the country as a whole, and please don't judge us on the fact that we have only picked a hundred. There will be 1,700 positions to fill in the executive branch and the White House senior staff and staff. And the personnel committee in our administration that is talent hunting and looking for these people contains members of the minorities, Hispanics, and even a majority of women, and we want that very much. So, don't judge us now by the tip of the iceberg. Wait till it's all in.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Mr. President? Yes, thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. President: Paul Volcker, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has been implementing policies that are exactly opposite in basic thrust from what you recommend. He has been squeezing the productive sector of the economy in favor of the speculative sector. Now, I mean frankly, Mr. President, there are important sections of the American economy that are about to go under and won't even have an opportunity to benefit from the programs that you're putting forward because of the Federal Reserve policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: I have a two-part question. First of all, do you think that objective economic conditions justify the interest rate levels that we now have? And I don't mean for your answer to imply criticism of the Fed; it's just an objective question. And the second question is, are you concerned that there might be a sabotage, so to speak, of your policies by programs that the Federal Reserve might be putting forward?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: No, I'm not concerned that there would be sabotage. I've met with Mr. Volcker, and not with the intention of trying to dictate, because it is an independent agency, and I respect that.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I think that we have to face the fact that interest rates are not in themselves a cause of inflation; they're a consequence. And when you have, as we have had, double-digit inflation back to back for 2 solid years now\\u2014the last time that happened was in World War I\\u2014and when you have double-digit inflation there, that way there is no question that interest rates are going to have to go up and follow that inflation rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, the answer to the interest rates is going to be our program of reducing government spending, tied to the reduction of the tax rates that we've spoken of to bring down inflation, and you'll find that interest rates come down. We do want from the Fed and would ask for a moderate policy of money supply increasing relative to legitimate growth. All of these things have to work together. But I don't think that the Fed just deliberately raises interest rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason that we've got to tie taxes and we have to tie spending together is we, for all these decades, we've talked and we've talked about solving these problems, and we've acted as if the two were separate. So, one year we fight inflation and then unemployment goes up, and then the next year we fight unemployment and inflation goes up. It's time to keep the two together where they belong, and that's what we're going to do. Yes, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, a number of conservative leaders, among them some of your staunchest and most durable supporters, such as Senator Jesse Helms, are very concerned about some of your appointments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basis of the concern is that many people who have been longtime Reaganites and supporters of yours do not seem to be able to get jobs, like Bill Van Cleave, who played a key role on your defense transition team, whereas other individuals who have not supported you throughout the years or your philosophy, like Mr. Terrel Bell, the Secretary of Education, who was for the establishment of the Department which you've said you're going to abolish, when Mr. Frank Carlucci, Deputy Secretary of Defense, who was not a supporter of yours, that they have gotten jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy question is, why are these individuals in your administration? Why isn't Mr. Van Cleave? And how much of a problem do you think this conservative dissatisfaction with your appointments is?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: The only problem that I've had that is more difficult than knowing which hand raised to point to here\\u2014and believe me, it bothers me; I go home feeling guilty for all the hands that I couldn't point to. [Laughter] The only problem greater I've had is in the selection of personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in many instances some of the people that have been mentioned, whose names that have been mentioned by others did not want a position in the administration-helped, worked very hard, and wanted nothing for it. But you also have to recognize there aren't that many positions. After all, look how many votes I had. You can't reward them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMs. Thomas: Thank you, Mr. President.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President: Thank you. All right. Thank you all very much.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"president\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 45,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dwight D.
