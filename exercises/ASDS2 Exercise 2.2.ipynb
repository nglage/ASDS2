In the general course of human nature, A POWER OVER A MAN's\\nSUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL. And we can never hope\\nto see realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial\\nfrom the legislative power, in any system which leaves the former\\ndependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the\\nlatter. The enlightened friends to good government in every State,\\nhave seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit\\nprecautions in the State constitutions on this head. Some of these\\nindeed have declared that PERMANENT [1] salaries should be\\nestablished for the judges; but the experiment has in some\\ninstances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite\\nto preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and\\nunequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The plan of the\\nconvention accordingly has provided that the judges of the United\\nStates \\\"shall at STATED TIMES receive for their services a\\ncompensation which shall not be DIMINISHED during their continuance\\nin office.\\\"\\n\\nThis, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible\\nprovision that could have been devised. It will readily be\\nunderstood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the\\nstate of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the\\nConstitution inadmissible. What might be extravagant to-day, might\\nin half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore\\nnecessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary\\nits provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet\\nunder such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body\\nto change the condition of the individual for the worse. A man may\\nthen be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be\\ndeterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less\\neligible situation. The clause which has been quoted combines both\\nadvantages. The salaries of judicial officers may from time to time\\nbe altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the\\nallowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in\\nrespect to him. It will be observed that a difference has been made\\nby the convention between the compensation of the President and of\\nthe judges, That of the former can neither be increased nor\\ndiminished; that of the latter can only not be diminished. This\\nprobably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective\\noffices. As the President is to be elected for no more than four\\nyears, it can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the\\ncommencement of that period, will not continue to be such to its end.\\nBut with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will\\nbe secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially\\nin the early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would\\nbe very sufficient at their first appointment, would become too\\nsmall in the progress of their service.\\n\\nThis provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of\\nprudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together\\nwith the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better\\nprospect of their independence than is discoverable in the\\nconstitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.\\n\\nThe precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the\\narticle respecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached\\nfor malconduct by the House of Representatives, and tried by the\\nSenate; and, if convicted, may be dismissed from office, and\\ndisqualified for holding any other. This is the only provision on\\nthe point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the\\njudicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own\\nConstitution in respect to our own judges.\\n\\nThe want of a provision for removing the judges on account of\\ninability has been a subject of complaint. But all considerate men\\nwill be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced\\nupon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any\\ngood purpose. The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, I\\nbelieve, no place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix\\nthe boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would\\nmuch oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and\\nenmities than advance the interests of justice or the public good.\\nThe result, except in the case of insanity, must for the most part\\nbe arbitrary; and insanity, without any formal or express\\nprovision, may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification.\\n\\nThe constitution of New York, to avoid investigations that must\\nforever be vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the\\ncriterion of inability. No man can be a judge beyond sixty. I\\nbelieve there are few at present who do not disapprove of this\\nprovision. There is no station, in relation to which it is less\\nproper than to that of a judge. The deliberating and comparing\\nfaculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period\\nin men who survive it; and when, in addition to this circumstance,\\nwe consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual\\nvigor, and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the\\nbench, whether more or less numerous, should be in such a situation\\nat the same time, we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of\\nthis sort have little to recommend them. In a republic, where\\nfortunes are not affluent, and pensions not expedient, the\\ndismission of men from stations in which they have served their\\ncountry long and usefully, on which they depend for subsistence, and\\nfrom which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for\\na livelihood, ought to have some better apology to humanity than is\\nto be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. Vide \\\"Constitution of Massachusetts,\\\" chapter 2, section\\nI, article 13.\\n\",\n          \"To the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nAFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the\\nsubsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on\\na new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject\\nspeaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences\\nnothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare\\nof the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many\\nrespects the most interesting in the world. It has been frequently\\nremarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this\\ncountry, by their conduct and example, to decide the important\\nquestion, whether societies of men are really capable or not of\\nestablishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether\\nthey are forever destined to depend for their political\\nconstitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth in the\\nremark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\\nregarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a\\nwrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve\\nto be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\\n\\nThis idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\\npatriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and\\ngood men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice\\nshould be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests,\\nunperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the\\npublic good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than\\nseriously to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations\\naffects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local\\ninstitutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects\\nforeign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little\\nfavorable to the discovery of truth.\\n\\nAmong the most formidable of the obstacles which the new\\nConstitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the\\nobvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist\\nall changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument,\\nand consequence of the offices they hold under the State\\nestablishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men,\\nwho will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of\\ntheir country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of\\nelevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial\\nconfederacies than from its union under one government.\\n\\nIt is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\\nnature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\\nindiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because\\ntheir situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or\\nambitious views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men\\nmay be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted\\nthat much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may\\nhereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless\\nat least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray\\nby preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so\\npowerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the\\njudgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the\\nwrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first\\nmagnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would\\nfurnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much\\npersuaded of their being in the right in any controversy. And a\\nfurther reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the\\nreflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the\\ntruth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists.\\nAmbition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many\\nother motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as\\nwell upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\\nquestion. Were there not even these inducements to moderation,\\nnothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which\\nhas, at all times, characterized political parties. For in\\npolitics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making\\nproselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be\\ncured by persecution.\\n\\nAnd yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we\\nhave already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as\\nin all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of\\nangry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the\\nconduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that\\nthey will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions,\\nand to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of\\ntheir declamations and the bitterness of their invectives. An\\nenlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be\\nstigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and\\nhostile to the principles of liberty. An over-scrupulous jealousy\\nof danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the\\nfault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere\\npretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense\\nof the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that\\njealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\\nenthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow\\nand illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally\\nforgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security\\nof liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed\\njudgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a\\ndangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal\\nfor the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of\\nzeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will\\nteach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to\\nthe introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men\\nwho have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number\\nhave begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people;\\ncommencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.\\n\\nIn the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye,\\nmy fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all\\nattempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a\\nmatter of the utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions\\nother than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You\\nwill, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general\\nscope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the\\nnew Constitution. Yes, my countrymen, I own to you that, after\\nhaving given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion\\nit is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced that this is the\\nsafest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I\\naffect not reserves which I do not feel. I will not amuse you with\\nan appearance of deliberation when I have decided. I frankly\\nacknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you\\nthe reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good\\nintentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\\nprofessions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository\\nof my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be\\njudged of by all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which\\nwill not disgrace the cause of truth.\\n\\nI propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following\\ninteresting particulars:\\n\\nTHE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY\\n\\nTHE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION\\nTO PRESERVE THAT UNION  THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST\\nEQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS\\nOBJECT  THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE\\nPRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT\\nITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION\\nand lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS\\nADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF\\nGOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\\n\\nIn the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\\nsatisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made\\ntheir appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\\n\\nIt may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to\\nprove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved\\non the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and\\none, which it may be imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is,\\nthat we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those\\nwho oppose the new Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too\\ngreat extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity\\nresort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the\\nwhole. [1] This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually\\npropagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open\\navowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to those who are\\nable to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative\\nof an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the\\nUnion. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the\\nadvantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable\\ndangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution.\\nThis shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is\\nheld out in several of the late publications against the new\\nConstitution.\\n\",\n          \"To the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nI PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed\\nExecutive, as they are marked out in the plan of the convention.\\nThis will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the\\nrepresentations which have been made in regard to it.\\n\\nThe first thing which strikes our attention is, that the\\nexecutive authority, with few exceptions, is to be vested in a\\nsingle magistrate. This will scarcely, however, be considered as a\\npoint upon which any comparison can be grounded; for if, in this\\nparticular, there be a resemblance to the king of Great Britain,\\nthere is not less a resemblance to the Grand Seignior, to the khan\\nof Tartary, to the Man of the Seven Mountains, or to the governor of\\nNew York.\\n\\nThat magistrate is to be elected for FOUR years; and is to be\\nre-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think\\nhim worthy of their confidence. In these circumstances there is a\\ntotal dissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain, who is\\nan HEREDITARY monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony\\ndescendible to his heirs forever; but there is a close analogy\\nbetween HIM and a governor of New York, who is elected for THREE\\nyears, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission. If we\\nconsider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a\\ndangerous influence in a single State, than for establishing a like\\ninfluence throughout the United States, we must conclude that a\\nduration of FOUR years for the Chief Magistrate of the Union is a\\ndegree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office, than a\\nduration of THREE years for a corresponding office in a single State.\\n\\nThe President of the United States would be liable to be\\nimpeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other\\nhigh crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would\\nafterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary\\ncourse of law. The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred\\nand inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is\\namenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without\\ninvolving the crisis of a national revolution. In this delicate and\\nimportant circumstance of personal responsibility, the President of\\nConfederated America would stand upon no better ground than a\\ngovernor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of\\nMaryland and Delaware.\\n\\nThe President of the United States is to have power to return a\\nbill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature,\\nfor reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law,\\nif, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both\\nhouses. The king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute\\nnegative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament. The disuse\\nof that power for a considerable time past does not affect the\\nreality of its existence; and is to be ascribed wholly to the\\ncrown's having found the means of substituting influence to\\nauthority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of\\nthe two houses, to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which\\ncould seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national\\nagitation. The qualified negative of the President differs widely\\nfrom this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and tallies\\nexactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of\\nthis State, of which the governor is a constituent part. In this\\nrespect the power of the President would exceed that of the governor\\nof New York, because the former would possess, singly, what the\\nlatter shares with the chancellor and judges; but it would be\\nprecisely the same with that of the governor of Massachusetts, whose\\nconstitution, as to this article, seems to have been the original\\nfrom which the convention have copied.\\n\\nThe President is to be the \\\"commander-in-chief of the army and\\nnavy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States,\\nwhen called into the actual service of the United States. He is to\\nhave power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the\\nUnited States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT; to recommend to the\\nconsideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary\\nand expedient; to convene, on extraordinary occasions, both houses\\nof the legislature, or either of them, and, in case of disagreement\\nbetween them WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF ADJOURNMENT, to adjourn\\nthem to such time as he shall think proper; to take care that the\\nlaws be faithfully executed; and to commission all officers of the\\nUnited States.\\\" In most of these particulars, the power of the\\nPresident will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain\\nand of the governor of New York. The most material points of\\ndifference are these:  First. The President will have only the\\noccasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by\\nlegislative provision may be called into the actual service of the\\nUnion. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have\\nat all times the entire command of all the militia within their\\nseveral jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the\\nPresident would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the\\ngovernor. Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief\\nof the army and navy of the United States. In this respect his\\nauthority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great\\nBritain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to\\nnothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military\\nand naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy;\\nwhile that of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and\\nto the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all which, by\\nthe Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the\\nlegislature. [1] The governor of New York, on the other hand, is\\nby the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its\\nmilitia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States\\nexpressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well\\nof the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those\\nof New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this\\ninstance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than\\ncould be claimed by a President of the United States. Thirdly.\\nThe power of the President, in respect to pardons, would extend to\\nall cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The governor of New York\\nmay pardon in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for\\ntreason and murder. Is not the power of the governor, in this\\narticle, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than\\nthat of the President? All conspiracies and plots against the\\ngovernment, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be\\nscreened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the\\nprerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore,\\nshould be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had\\nbeen ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices\\nand adherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union, on the\\nother hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in\\nthe ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any\\ndegree, from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not\\nthe prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a\\ngreater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise\\nagainst the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption\\nfrom death and confiscation, if the final execution of the design,\\nupon an actual appeal to arms, should miscarry? Would this last\\nexpectation have any influence at all, when the probability was\\ncomputed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might\\nhimself be involved in the consequences of the measure, and might be\\nincapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired\\nimpunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary\\nto recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of\\ntreason is limited \\\"to levying war upon the United States, and\\nadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort\\\"; and that\\nby the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds.\\nFourthly. The President can only adjourn the national legislature\\nin the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment.\\nThe British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament.\\nThe governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this\\nState for a limited time; a power which, in certain situations, may\\nbe employed to very important purposes.\\n\\nThe President is to have power, with the advice and consent of\\nthe Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators\\npresent concur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute\\nrepresentative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of\\nhis own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of\\nevery other description. It has been insinuated, that his authority\\nin this respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with\\nforeign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the\\nratification, of Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never\\nheard of, until it was broached upon the present occasion. Every\\njurist [2] of that kingdom, and every other man acquainted with its\\nConstitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of\\nmaking treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plentitude; and\\nthat the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most\\ncomplete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other\\nsanction. The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing\\nitself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the\\nstipulations in a new treaty; and this may have possibly given\\nbirth to the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the\\nobligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary\\ninterposition proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity\\nof adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and\\ncommercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the\\ntreaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new\\nstate of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. In\\nthis respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended\\npower of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign.\\nThe one can perform alone what the other can do only with the\\nconcurrence of a branch of the legislature. It must be admitted,\\nthat, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would\\nexceed that of any State Executive. But this arises naturally from\\nthe sovereign power which relates to treaties. If the Confederacy\\nwere to be dissolved, it would become a question, whether the\\nExecutives of the several States were not solely invested with that\\ndelicate and important prerogative.\\n\\nThe President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors\\nand other public ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme\\nof declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It\\nis a circumstance which will be without consequence in the\\nadministration of the government; and it was far more convenient\\nthat it should be arranged in this manner, than that there should be\\na necessity of convening the legislature, or one of its branches,\\nupon every arrival of a foreign minister, though it were merely to\\ntake the place of a departed predecessor.\\n\\nThe President is to nominate, and, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT\\nOF THE SENATE, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers,\\njudges of the Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the\\nUnited States established by law, and whose appointments are not\\notherwise provided for by the Constitution. The king of Great\\nBritain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor. He\\nnot only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can\\nconfer titles of nobility at pleasure; and has the disposal of an\\nimmense number of church preferments. There is evidently a great\\ninferiority in the power of the President, in this particular, to\\nthat of the British king; nor is it equal to that of the governor\\nof New York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution\\nof the State by the practice which has obtained under it. The power\\nof appointment is with us lodged in a council, composed of the\\ngovernor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly.\\nThe governor CLAIMS, and has frequently EXERCISED, the right of\\nnomination, and is ENTITLED to a casting vote in the appointment.\\nIf he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this\\nrespect equal to that of the President, and exceeds it in the\\narticle of the casting vote. In the national government, if the\\nSenate should be divided, no appointment could be made; in the\\ngovernment of New York, if the council should be divided, the\\ngovernor can turn the scale, and confirm his own nomination. [3]\\nIf we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode\\nof appointment by the President and an entire branch of the national\\nlegislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the\\ngovernor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most\\nfour, and frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same\\ntime consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small\\nnumber of which a council of appointment consists, than the\\nconsiderable number of which the national Senate would consist, we\\ncannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate\\nof this State, in the disposition of offices, must, in practice, be\\ngreatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union.\\n\\nHence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of\\nthe President in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to\\ndetermine whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess\\nmore or less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears\\nyet more unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel\\nwhich has been attempted between him and the king of Great Britain.\\nBut to render the contrast in this respect still more striking, it\\nmay be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude\\ninto a closer group.\\n\\nThe President of the United States would be an officer elected\\nby the people for FOUR years; the king of Great Britain is a\\nperpetual and HEREDITARY prince. The one would be amenable to\\npersonal punishment and disgrace; the person of the other is sacred\\nand inviolable. The one would have a QUALIFIED negative upon the\\nacts of the legislative body; the other has an ABSOLUTE negative.\\nThe one would have a right to command the military and naval forces\\nof the nation; the other, in addition to this right, possesses that\\nof DECLARING war, and of RAISING and REGULATING fleets and armies by\\nhis own authority. The one would have a concurrent power with a\\nbranch of the legislature in the formation of treaties; the other\\nis the SOLE POSSESSOR of the power of making treaties. The one\\nwould have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices;\\nthe other is the sole author of all appointments. The one can\\nconfer no privileges whatever; the other can make denizens of\\naliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the\\nrights incident to corporate bodies. The one can prescribe no rules\\nconcerning the commerce or currency of the nation; the other is in\\nseveral respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity can\\nestablish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can\\nlay embargoes for a limited time, can coin money, can authorize or\\nprohibit the circulation of foreign coin. The one has no particle\\nof spiritual jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and\\ngovernor of the national church! What answer shall we give to those\\nwho would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other?\\nThe same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a\\ngovernment, the whole power of which would be in the hands of the\\nelective and periodical servants of the people, is an aristocracy, a\\nmonarchy, and a despotism.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. A writer in a Pennsylvania paper, under the signature of\\nTAMONY, has asserted that the king of Great Britain owes his\\nprerogative as commander-in-chief to an annual mutiny bill. The\\ntruth is, on the contrary, that his prerogative, in this respect, is\\nimmemorial, and was only disputed, \\\"contrary to all reason and\\nprecedent,\\\" as Blackstone vol. i., page 262, expresses it, by the\\nLong Parliament of Charles I. but by the statute the 13th of Charles\\nII., chap. 6, it was declared to be in the king alone, for that the\\nsole supreme government and command of the militia within his\\nMajesty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by sea and land,\\nand of all forts and places of strength, EVER WAS AND IS the\\nundoubted right of his Majesty and his royal predecessors, kings and\\nqueens of England, and that both or either house of Parliament\\ncannot nor ought to pretend to the same.\\n\\n2. Vide Blackstone's \\\"Commentaries,\\\" vol i., p. 257.\\n\\n3. Candor, however, demands an acknowledgment that I do not think\\nthe claim of the governor to a right of nomination well founded.\\nYet it is always justifiable to reason from the practice of a\\ngovernment, till its propriety has been constitutionally questioned.\\nAnd independent of this claim, when we take into view the other\\nconsiderations, and pursue them through all their consequences, we\\nshall be inclined to draw much the same conclusion.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 39,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Friday, March 14, 1788\",\n          \"Tuesday, March 25, 1788\",\n          \"Tuesday, December 4, 1787\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 71,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Concerning the General Power of Taxation\",\n          \"General Introduction\",\n          \"The Senate Continued\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"paper_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 24,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 85,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 85,\n        \"samples\": [\n          79,\n          1,\n          69\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"venue\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"For the Independent Journal\",\n          \"From the New York Packet\",\n          \"From MCLEAN's Edition, New York\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In the general course of human nature, A POWER OVER A MAN's\\nSUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL. And we can never hope\\nto see realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial\\nfrom the legislative power, in any system which leaves the former\\ndependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the\\nlatter. The enlightened friends to good government in every State,\\nhave seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit\\nprecautions in the State constitutions on this head. Some of these\\nindeed have declared that PERMANENT [1] salaries should be\\nestablished for the judges; but the experiment has in some\\ninstances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite\\nto preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and\\nunequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The plan of the\\nconvention accordingly has provided that the judges of the United\\nStates \\\"shall at STATED TIMES receive for their services a\\ncompensation which shall not be DIMINISHED during their continuance\\nin office.\\\"\\n\\nThis, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible\\nprovision that could have been devised. It will readily be\\nunderstood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the\\nstate of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the\\nConstitution inadmissible. What might be extravagant to-day, might\\nin half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore\\nnecessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary\\nits provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet\\nunder such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body\\nto change the condition of the individual for the worse. A man may\\nthen be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be\\ndeterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less\\neligible situation. The clause which has been quoted combines both\\nadvantages. The salaries of judicial officers may from time to time\\nbe altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the\\nallowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in\\nrespect to him. It will be observed that a difference has been made\\nby the convention between the compensation of the President and of\\nthe judges, That of the former can neither be increased nor\\ndiminished; that of the latter can only not be diminished. This\\nprobably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective\\noffices. As the President is to be elected for no more than four\\nyears, it can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the\\ncommencement of that period, will not continue to be such to its end.\\nBut with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will\\nbe secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially\\nin the early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would\\nbe very sufficient at their first appointment, would become too\\nsmall in the progress of their service.\\n\\nThis provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of\\nprudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together\\nwith the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better\\nprospect of their independence than is discoverable in the\\nconstitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.\\n\\nThe precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the\\narticle respecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached\\nfor malconduct by the House of Representatives, and tried by the\\nSenate; and, if convicted, may be dismissed from office, and\\ndisqualified for holding any other. This is the only provision on\\nthe point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the\\njudicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own\\nConstitution in respect to our own judges.\\n\\nThe want of a provision for removing the judges on account of\\ninability has been a subject of complaint. But all considerate men\\nwill be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced\\nupon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any\\ngood purpose. The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, I\\nbelieve, no place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix\\nthe boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would\\nmuch oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and\\nenmities than advance the interests of justice or the public good.\\nThe result, except in the case of insanity, must for the most part\\nbe arbitrary; and insanity, without any formal or express\\nprovision, may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification.\\n\\nThe constitution of New York, to avoid investigations that must\\nforever be vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the\\ncriterion of inability. No man can be a judge beyond sixty. I\\nbelieve there are few at present who do not disapprove of this\\nprovision. There is no station, in relation to which it is less\\nproper than to that of a judge. The deliberating and comparing\\nfaculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period\\nin men who survive it; and when, in addition to this circumstance,\\nwe consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual\\nvigor, and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the\\nbench, whether more or less numerous, should be in such a situation\\nat the same time, we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of\\nthis sort have little to recommend them. In a republic, where\\nfortunes are not affluent, and pensions not expedient, the\\ndismission of men from stations in which they have served their\\ncountry long and usefully, on which they depend for subsistence, and\\nfrom which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for\\na livelihood, ought to have some better apology to humanity than is\\nto be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. Vide \\\"Constitution of Massachusetts,\\\" chapter 2, section\\nI, article 13.\\n\",\n          \"To the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nAFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the\\nsubsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on\\na new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject\\nspeaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences\\nnothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare\\nof the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many\\nrespects the most interesting in the world. It has been frequently\\nremarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this\\ncountry, by their conduct and example, to decide the important\\nquestion, whether societies of men are really capable or not of\\nestablishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether\\nthey are forever destined to depend for their political\\nconstitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth in the\\nremark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\\nregarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a\\nwrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve\\nto be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\\n\\nThis idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\\npatriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and\\ngood men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice\\nshould be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests,\\nunperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the\\npublic good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than\\nseriously to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations\\naffects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local\\ninstitutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects\\nforeign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little\\nfavorable to the discovery of truth.\\n\\nAmong the most formidable of the obstacles which the new\\nConstitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the\\nobvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist\\nall changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument,\\nand consequence of the offices they hold under the State\\nestablishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men,\\nwho will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of\\ntheir country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of\\nelevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial\\nconfederacies than from its union under one government.\\n\\nIt is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\\nnature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\\nindiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because\\ntheir situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or\\nambitious views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men\\nmay be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted\\nthat much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may\\nhereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless\\nat least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray\\nby preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so\\npowerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the\\njudgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the\\nwrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first\\nmagnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would\\nfurnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much\\npersuaded of their being in the right in any controversy. And a\\nfurther reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the\\nreflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the\\ntruth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists.\\nAmbition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many\\nother motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as\\nwell upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\\nquestion. Were there not even these inducements to moderation,\\nnothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which\\nhas, at all times, characterized political parties. For in\\npolitics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making\\nproselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be\\ncured by persecution.\\n\\nAnd yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we\\nhave already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as\\nin all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of\\nangry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the\\nconduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that\\nthey will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions,\\nand to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of\\ntheir declamations and the bitterness of their invectives. An\\nenlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be\\nstigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and\\nhostile to the principles of liberty. An over-scrupulous jealousy\\nof danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the\\nfault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere\\npretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense\\nof the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that\\njealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\\nenthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow\\nand illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally\\nforgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security\\nof liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed\\njudgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a\\ndangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal\\nfor the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of\\nzeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will\\nteach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to\\nthe introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men\\nwho have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number\\nhave begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people;\\ncommencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.\\n\\nIn the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye,\\nmy fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all\\nattempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a\\nmatter of the utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions\\nother than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You\\nwill, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general\\nscope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the\\nnew Constitution. Yes, my countrymen, I own to you that, after\\nhaving given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion\\nit is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced that this is the\\nsafest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I\\naffect not reserves which I do not feel. I will not amuse you with\\nan appearance of deliberation when I have decided. I frankly\\nacknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you\\nthe reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good\\nintentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\\nprofessions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository\\nof my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be\\njudged of by all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which\\nwill not disgrace the cause of truth.\\n\\nI propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following\\ninteresting particulars:\\n\\nTHE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY\\n\\nTHE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION\\nTO PRESERVE THAT UNION  THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST\\nEQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS\\nOBJECT  THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE\\nPRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT\\nITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION\\nand lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS\\nADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF\\nGOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\\n\\nIn the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\\nsatisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made\\ntheir appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\\n\\nIt may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to\\nprove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved\\non the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and\\none, which it may be imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is,\\nthat we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those\\nwho oppose the new Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too\\ngreat extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity\\nresort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the\\nwhole. [1] This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually\\npropagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open\\navowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to those who are\\nable to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative\\nof an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the\\nUnion. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the\\nadvantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable\\ndangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution.\\nThis shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is\\nheld out in several of the late publications against the new\\nConstitution.\\n\",\n          \"To the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nI PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed\\nExecutive, as they are marked out in the plan of the convention.\\nThis will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the\\nrepresentations which have been made in regard to it.\\n\\nThe first thing which strikes our attention is, that the\\nexecutive authority, with few exceptions, is to be vested in a\\nsingle magistrate. This will scarcely, however, be considered as a\\npoint upon which any comparison can be grounded; for if, in this\\nparticular, there be a resemblance to the king of Great Britain,\\nthere is not less a resemblance to the Grand Seignior, to the khan\\nof Tartary, to the Man of the Seven Mountains, or to the governor of\\nNew York.\\n\\nThat magistrate is to be elected for FOUR years; and is to be\\nre-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think\\nhim worthy of their confidence. In these circumstances there is a\\ntotal dissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain, who is\\nan HEREDITARY monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony\\ndescendible to his heirs forever; but there is a close analogy\\nbetween HIM and a governor of New York, who is elected for THREE\\nyears, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission. If we\\nconsider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a\\ndangerous influence in a single State, than for establishing a like\\ninfluence throughout the United States, we must conclude that a\\nduration of FOUR years for the Chief Magistrate of the Union is a\\ndegree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office, than a\\nduration of THREE years for a corresponding office in a single State.\\n\\nThe President of the United States would be liable to be\\nimpeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other\\nhigh crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would\\nafterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary\\ncourse of law. The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred\\nand inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is\\namenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without\\ninvolving the crisis of a national revolution. In this delicate and\\nimportant circumstance of personal responsibility, the President of\\nConfederated America would stand upon no better ground than a\\ngovernor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of\\nMaryland and Delaware.\\n\\nThe President of the United States is to have power to return a\\nbill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature,\\nfor reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law,\\nif, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both\\nhouses. The king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute\\nnegative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament. The disuse\\nof that power for a considerable time past does not affect the\\nreality of its existence; and is to be ascribed wholly to the\\ncrown's having found the means of substituting influence to\\nauthority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of\\nthe two houses, to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which\\ncould seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national\\nagitation. The qualified negative of the President differs widely\\nfrom this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and tallies\\nexactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of\\nthis State, of which the governor is a constituent part. In this\\nrespect the power of the President would exceed that of the governor\\nof New York, because the former would possess, singly, what the\\nlatter shares with the chancellor and judges; but it would be\\nprecisely the same with that of the governor of Massachusetts, whose\\nconstitution, as to this article, seems to have been the original\\nfrom which the convention have copied.\\n\\nThe President is to be the \\\"commander-in-chief of the army and\\nnavy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States,\\nwhen called into the actual service of the United States. He is to\\nhave power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the\\nUnited States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT; to recommend to the\\nconsideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary\\nand expedient; to convene, on extraordinary occasions, both houses\\nof the legislature, or either of them, and, in case of disagreement\\nbetween them WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF ADJOURNMENT, to adjourn\\nthem to such time as he shall think proper; to take care that the\\nlaws be faithfully executed; and to commission all officers of the\\nUnited States.\\\" In most of these particulars, the power of the\\nPresident will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain\\nand of the governor of New York. The most material points of\\ndifference are these:  First. The President will have only the\\noccasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by\\nlegislative provision may be called into the actual service of the\\nUnion. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have\\nat all times the entire command of all the militia within their\\nseveral jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the\\nPresident would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the\\ngovernor. Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief\\nof the army and navy of the United States. In this respect his\\nauthority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great\\nBritain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to\\nnothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military\\nand naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy;\\nwhile that of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and\\nto the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all which, by\\nthe Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the\\nlegislature. [1] The governor of New York, on the other hand, is\\nby the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its\\nmilitia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States\\nexpressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well\\nof the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those\\nof New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this\\ninstance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than\\ncould be claimed by a President of the United States. Thirdly.\\nThe power of the President, in respect to pardons, would extend to\\nall cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The governor of New York\\nmay pardon in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for\\ntreason and murder. Is not the power of the governor, in this\\narticle, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than\\nthat of the President? All conspiracies and plots against the\\ngovernment, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be\\nscreened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the\\nprerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore,\\nshould be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had\\nbeen ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices\\nand adherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union, on the\\nother hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in\\nthe ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any\\ndegree, from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not\\nthe prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a\\ngreater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise\\nagainst the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption\\nfrom death and confiscation, if the final execution of the design,\\nupon an actual appeal to arms, should miscarry? Would this last\\nexpectation have any influence at all, when the probability was\\ncomputed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might\\nhimself be involved in the consequences of the measure, and might be\\nincapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired\\nimpunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary\\nto recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of\\ntreason is limited \\\"to levying war upon the United States, and\\nadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort\\\"; and that\\nby the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds.\\nFourthly. The President can only adjourn the national legislature\\nin the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment.\\nThe British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament.\\nThe governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this\\nState for a limited time; a power which, in certain situations, may\\nbe employed to very important purposes.\\n\\nThe President is to have power, with the advice and consent of\\nthe Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators\\npresent concur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute\\nrepresentative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of\\nhis own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of\\nevery other description. It has been insinuated, that his authority\\nin this respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with\\nforeign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the\\nratification, of Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never\\nheard of, until it was broached upon the present occasion. Every\\njurist [2] of that kingdom, and every other man acquainted with its\\nConstitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of\\nmaking treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plentitude; and\\nthat the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most\\ncomplete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other\\nsanction. The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing\\nitself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the\\nstipulations in a new treaty; and this may have possibly given\\nbirth to the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the\\nobligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary\\ninterposition proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity\\nof adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and\\ncommercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the\\ntreaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new\\nstate of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. In\\nthis respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended\\npower of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign.\\nThe one can perform alone what the other can do only with the\\nconcurrence of a branch of the legislature. It must be admitted,\\nthat, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would\\nexceed that of any State Executive. But this arises naturally from\\nthe sovereign power which relates to treaties. If the Confederacy\\nwere to be dissolved, it would become a question, whether the\\nExecutives of the several States were not solely invested with that\\ndelicate and important prerogative.\\n\\nThe President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors\\nand other public ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme\\nof declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It\\nis a circumstance which will be without consequence in the\\nadministration of the government; and it was far more convenient\\nthat it should be arranged in this manner, than that there should be\\na necessity of convening the legislature, or one of its branches,\\nupon every arrival of a foreign minister, though it were merely to\\ntake the place of a departed predecessor.\\n\\nThe President is to nominate, and, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT\\nOF THE SENATE, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers,\\njudges of the Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the\\nUnited States established by law, and whose appointments are not\\notherwise provided for by the Constitution. The king of Great\\nBritain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor. He\\nnot only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can\\nconfer titles of nobility at pleasure; and has the disposal of an\\nimmense number of church preferments. There is evidently a great\\ninferiority in the power of the President, in this particular, to\\nthat of the British king; nor is it equal to that of the governor\\nof New York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution\\nof the State by the practice which has obtained under it. The power\\nof appointment is with us lodged in a council, composed of the\\ngovernor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly.\\nThe governor CLAIMS, and has frequently EXERCISED, the right of\\nnomination, and is ENTITLED to a casting vote in the appointment.\\nIf he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this\\nrespect equal to that of the President, and exceeds it in the\\narticle of the casting vote. In the national government, if the\\nSenate should be divided, no appointment could be made; in the\\ngovernment of New York, if the council should be divided, the\\ngovernor can turn the scale, and confirm his own nomination. [3]\\nIf we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode\\nof appointment by the President and an entire branch of the national\\nlegislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the\\ngovernor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most\\nfour, and frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same\\ntime consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small\\nnumber of which a council of appointment consists, than the\\nconsiderable number of which the national Senate would consist, we\\ncannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate\\nof this State, in the disposition of offices, must, in practice, be\\ngreatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union.\\n\\nHence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of\\nthe President in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to\\ndetermine whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess\\nmore or less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears\\nyet more unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel\\nwhich has been attempted between him and the king of Great Britain.\\nBut to render the contrast in this respect still more striking, it\\nmay be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude\\ninto a closer group.\\n\\nThe President of the United States would be an officer elected\\nby the people for FOUR years; the king of Great Britain is a\\nperpetual and HEREDITARY prince. The one would be amenable to\\npersonal punishment and disgrace; the person of the other is sacred\\nand inviolable. The one would have a QUALIFIED negative upon the\\nacts of the legislative body; the other has an ABSOLUTE negative.\\nThe one would have a right to command the military and naval forces\\nof the nation; the other, in addition to this right, possesses that\\nof DECLARING war, and of RAISING and REGULATING fleets and armies by\\nhis own authority. The one would have a concurrent power with a\\nbranch of the legislature in the formation of treaties; the other\\nis the SOLE POSSESSOR of the power of making treaties. The one\\nwould have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices;\\nthe other is the sole author of all appointments. The one can\\nconfer no privileges whatever; the other can make denizens of\\naliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the\\nrights incident to corporate bodies. The one can prescribe no rules\\nconcerning the commerce or currency of the nation; the other is in\\nseveral respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity can\\nestablish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can\\nlay embargoes for a limited time, can coin money, can authorize or\\nprohibit the circulation of foreign coin. The one has no particle\\nof spiritual jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and\\ngovernor of the national church! What answer shall we give to those\\nwho would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other?\\nThe same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a\\ngovernment, the whole power of which would be in the hands of the\\nelective and periodical servants of the people, is an aristocracy, a\\nmonarchy, and a despotism.\\n\\nPUBLIUS.\\n\\n1. A writer in a Pennsylvania paper, under the signature of\\nTAMONY, has asserted that the king of Great Britain owes his\\nprerogative as commander-in-chief to an annual mutiny bill. The\\ntruth is, on the contrary, that his prerogative, in this respect, is\\nimmemorial, and was only disputed, \\\"contrary to all reason and\\nprecedent,\\\" as Blackstone vol. i., page 262, expresses it, by the\\nLong Parliament of Charles I. but by the statute the 13th of Charles\\nII., chap. 6, it was declared to be in the king alone, for that the\\nsole supreme government and command of the militia within his\\nMajesty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by sea and land,\\nand of all forts and places of strength, EVER WAS AND IS the\\nundoubted right of his Majesty and his royal predecessors, kings and\\nqueens of England, and that both or either house of Parliament\\ncannot nor ought to pretend to the same.\\n\\n2.
