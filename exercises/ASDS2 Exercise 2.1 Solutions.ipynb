    "# Exercise: Word discovery \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are going to use the keyword expansion technique propsoed in `Computer-Assisted Keyword and Document Set Discovery from Unstructured Text` by King, Lam and Roberts (2017), in order to label a dataset of tweets according to whether or not they are related to covid-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to use an initial list of keywords to label the date, and then use supervised learning to expand the list of keywords to get a better sense of how people talk about a topic. It is an iterative approach, meaning that you start with a list of keywords, and expand it, run it again etc. until you saturate the list. The approach also emphasises that you should read some of the text that you label, in order to ensure correct labelling. \n",

    "\n",
    "1) Define two lists of indices: One list containing the indices of the tweets in the reference set (those labelled as belonging to the covid-19 topic), and another list containing N sample of tweets not from the reference set (N should be either 2x the amount of tweets in the reference set or 50000, whichever is smaller).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You now have 2 lists of indices – use these to subset the Document Term Matrix (where each row represents a tweet, and each column a token) and the reference set column in the dataframe (the labels). Define a train DTM and  a train labels object. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fit a cross validated lasso regression, using the DTM subset as input (X) and the reference subset as labels (y). This means that we are trying to predict whether a tweet is in the reference set using the term frequencies. (Hint:  use sklearn's `linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV()`). This may take some time (approx. 5 min, depending on the size of your train data).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Use the fitted model to make predictions on the full DTM, and create a column in the dataframe called `predicted_raw` based on this. (Remember that the rows in the DTM correspond to the rows in the dataframe).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) The prediction outputs propabilities and not classes, so check the standard deviation of the predicion_raw column - this will check if we actually have some variance in the prediction. This is just a sanity check.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Set a threshold of 0.25, and assign 1 or 0 to a new column called `predicted`, depending on whether the probability in `predicted_raw` is >= the threshold. (Note: Keep the threshold low if you want more tweets to get into the target set).\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Create a column called `set_var`. This variable should be == \"Reference\" if the observation is in the reference set (our original covid-19 labels), \"Target\" if it is _predicted_ to be a covid-19 related tweet (1) and \"Not target\" if it is _predicted_ not to be (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Create a crosstable of the prediciton and set_var, to see how you model does (hint: use use `pd.crosstab()`). Examine the crosstab - what do the different entries mean? "
